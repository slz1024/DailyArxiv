| **[Crossfire: An Elastic Defense Framework for Graph Neural Networks Under Bit Flip Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13776v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) are a well-established class of adversarial attacks, originally developed for Convolutional Neural Networks within the computer vision domain. Most recently, these attacks have been extended to target Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), revealing significant vulnerabilities. This new development naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs against BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the applications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only maintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its pre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also eliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network quality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot- and hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain to GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome their limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight sparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of out-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is retraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160 experiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher probability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to its pre-attack state. These experiments cover up to 55 bit flips from various attacks. Moreover, it improves post-repair prediction quality by 10.85%. Computational and storage overheads are negligible compared to the inherent complexity of even the simplest GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025, DOI will be included after publication</p></details> |
| **[Sample complexity of data-driven tuning of model hyperparameters in neural networks with structured parameter-dependent dual function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13734v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Road to Learning Explainable Inverse Kinematic Models: Graph Neural Networks as Inductive Bias for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13641v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper shows how a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can be used to learn an Inverse Kinematics (IK) based on an automatically generated dataset. The generated Inverse Kinematics is generalized to a family of manipulators with the same Degree of Freedom (DOF), but varying link length configurations. The results indicate a position error of less than 1.0 cm for 3 DOF and 4.5 cm for 5 DOF, and orientation error of 2$^\circ$ for 3 DOF and 8.2$^\circ$ for 6 DOF, which allows the deployment to certain real world-problems. However, out-of-domain errors and lack of extrapolation can be observed in the resulting GNN. An extensive analysis of these errors indicates potential for enhancement in the future. Consequently, the generated GNNs are tailored to be used in future work as an inductive bias to generate analytical equations through symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGrAINS: Personalized SubGraph Federated Learning with Adaptive Neighbor Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12592v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are crucial for modeling relational and biological data. As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SDM2025 (SIAM Data Mining 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VARFVV: View-Adaptive Real-Time Interactive Free-View Video Streaming with Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13630v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-view video (FVV) allows users to explore immersive video content from multiple views. However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/qianghu-huber/VARFVV.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13493v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[MeshMask: Physics-Based Simulations with Masked Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08738v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIDA: A Robust Attack Framework on Incomplete Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18170v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vital in data science but are increasingly susceptible to adversarial attacks. To help researchers develop more robust GNN models, it's essential to focus on designing strong attack models as foundational benchmarks and guiding references. Among adversarial attacks, gray-box poisoning attacks are noteworthy due to their effectiveness and fewer constraints. These attacks exploit GNNs' need for retraining on updated data, thereby impacting their performance by perturbing these datasets. However, current research overlooks the real-world scenario of incomplete graphs.To address this gap, we introduce the Robust Incomplete Deep Attack Framework (RIDA). It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs. The approach innovatively aggregates distant vertex information and ensures powerful data utilization.Extensive tests against 9 SOTA baselines on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate RIDA's superiority in handling incompleteness and high attack performance on the incomplete graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25)</p></details> |
| **[KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Graphical Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08812v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for many robot manipulators. Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned IK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize -- a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations for a local optimization process.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Stress Predictions in Polycrystal Plasticity using Graph Neural Networks with Subgraph Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05169v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical modeling of polycrystal plasticity is computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures (main manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Inverse Design for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08797v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) has significantly advanced the automation of digital circuits design, yet the need for expertise and time in pragma tuning remains challenging. Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HierPromptLM: A Pure PLM-based Framework for Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Text-rich Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12857v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on heterogeneous text-rich networks (HTRNs), which consist of multiple types of nodes and edges with each node associated with textual information, is essential for various real-world applications. Given the success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in processing text data, recent efforts have focused on integrating PLMs into HTRN representation learning. These methods typically handle textual and structural information separately, using both PLMs and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). However, this separation fails to capture the critical interactions between these two types of information within HTRNs. Additionally, it necessitates an extra alignment step, which is challenging due to the fundamental differences between distinct embedding spaces generated by PLMs and HGNNs. To deal with it, we propose HierPromptLM, a novel pure PLM-based framework that seamlessly models both text data and graph structures without the need for separate processing. Firstly, we develop a Hierarchical Prompt module that employs prompt learning to integrate text data and heterogeneous graph structures at both the node and edge levels, within a unified textual space. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce two innovative HTRN-tailored pretraining tasks to fine-tune PLMs for representation learning by emphasizing the inherent heterogeneity and interactions between textual and structural information within HTRNs. Extensive experiments on two real-world HTRN datasets demonstrate HierPromptLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements of up to 6.08% for node classification and 10.84% for link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAMA: Adaptive Graph Autoregressive Moving Average Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12732v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been introduced to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling long-range interactions. Despite their success, existing methods either compromise on permutation equivariance or limit their focus to pairwise interactions rather than sequences. Building on the connection between Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and SSM, in this paper, we introduce GRAMA, a Graph Adaptive method based on a learnable Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) framework that addresses these limitations. By transforming from static to sequential graph data, GRAMA leverages the strengths of the ARMA framework, while preserving permutation equivariance. Moreover, GRAMA incorporates a selective attention mechanism for dynamic learning of ARMA coefficients, enabling efficient and flexible long-range information propagation. We also establish theoretical connections between GRAMA and Selective SSMs, providing insights into its ability to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on 14 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GRAMA consistently outperforms backbone models and performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN KAN Buff Signed Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00709v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning aims to create effective embeddings for nodes and edges that encapsulate their features and relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Heterogeneity and Uncertainty for Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis Models in Intelligent Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05559v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has attracted much research interest due to its strong ability on inferring students' proficiency levels on knowledge concepts. While graph-based CD models have demonstrated remarkable performance, we contend that they still cannot achieve optimal performance due to the neglect of edge heterogeneity and uncertainty. Edges involve both correct and incorrect response logs, indicating heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a response log can have uncertain semantic meanings, e.g., a correct log can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing, and a wrong log can indicate a lack of understanding or a careless mistake. In this paper, we propose an Informative Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ISG-CD), which focuses on how to utilize the heterogeneous graph in CD and minimize effects of uncertain edges. Specifically, to explore heterogeneity, we propose a semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model. To minimize effects of edge uncertainty, we propose an Informative Edge Differentiation layer from an information bottleneck perspective, which suggests keeping a minimal yet sufficient reliable graph for CD in an unsupervised way. We formulate this process as maximizing mutual information between the reliable graph and response logs, while minimizing mutual information between the reliable graph and the original graph. After that, we prove that mutual information maximization can be theoretically converted to the classic binary cross entropy loss function, while minimizing mutual information can be realized by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Finally, we adopt an alternating training strategy for optimizing learnable parameters of both the semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model and the edge differentiation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ISG-CD.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce "Abductive Past Action Inference", a novel research task aimed at identifying the past actions performed by individuals within homes to reach specific states captured in a single image, using abductive inference. The research explores three key abductive inference problems: past action set prediction, past action sequence prediction, and abductive past action verification. We introduce several models tailored for abductive past action inference, including a relational graph neural network, a relational bilinear pooling model, and a relational transformer model. Notably, the newly proposed object-relational bilinear graph encoder-decoder (BiGED) model emerges as the most effective among all methods evaluated, demonstrating good proficiency in handling the intricacies of the Action Genome dataset. The contributions of this research significantly advance the ability of deep learning models to reason about current scene evidence and make highly plausible inferences about past human actions. This advancement enables a deeper understanding of events and behaviors, which can enhance decision-making and improve system capabilities across various real-world applications such as Human-Robot Interaction and Elderly Care and Health Monitoring.

| **[A Unified Invariant Learning Framework for Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12595v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification, based on the premise that these features causally determine the target label, and their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line, most studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing explicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and primarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph representations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may not accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce the Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It provides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both structural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable features. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance principle by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable features across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic invariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should demonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize superior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive experiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL considerably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading baseline methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/yongduosui/UIL.</p></details> | Accepted to KDD 2025 |
| **[A Hybrid Supervised and Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network for Edge-Centric Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12309v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel graph-based deep learning model for tasks involving relations between two nodes (edge-centric tasks), where the focus lies on predicting relationships and interactions between pairs of nodes rather than node properties themselves. This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Word and Phrase Features in Graph Convolutional Network for Automatic Question Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02481v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective question classification is crucial for AI-driven educational tools, enabling adaptive learning systems to categorize questions by skill area, difficulty level, and competence. This classification not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in natural language, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) to better model the inherent structure of questions. By representing questions as graphs-where nodes signify words or phrases and edges denote syntactic or semantic relationships-our method allows the model to learn from the interconnected nature of language more effectively. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question datasets of various domains and characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model, augmented with these features, offer a promising solution for more robust and context-aware question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and practical educational applications of AI.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often fall short in handling high-noise and low-contrast images in complex underwater environments, lacking precision and robustness. This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT model that combines GraphSage, SVAM, and DSGAT modules, enhancing feature extraction and target detection capabilities through graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate real-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and model responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT model achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the SeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models. This IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex backgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the system. This research provides an effective IoT solution for underwater target detection technology, offering significant practical application value and broad development prospects.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

HIL simulation platforms enable the integration of computational models with physical devices, allowing rigorous testing across diverse scenarios critical to system resilience and reliability. In this study, we develop a SafePowerGraph-HIL framework that utilizes HIL simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system, modeled in Hypersim, to generate high-fidelity data, which is then transmitted in real-time via SCADA to an AWS cloud database before being input into a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model designed for power system state estimation and dynamic analysis. By leveraging Hypersim's capabilities, we simulate complex grid interactions, providing a robust dataset that captures critical parameters for HGNN training. The trained HGNN is subsequently validated using newly generated data under varied system conditions, demonstrating accuracy and robustness in predicting power system states. The results underscore the potential of integrating HIL with advanced neural network architectures to enhance the real-time operational capabilities of power systems.

Some of them use the shortest dependency path(SDP) information to represent the argument classification task. There is an issue with this representation since even missing one word from the dependency parsing graph may totally change the final prediction. To this end, the full adjacency matrix of the dependency graph is used to embed individual tokens using a graph convolutional network(GCN). An ablation study is also done to show the effect of the dependency graph on the overall performance. The results show a significant improvement when dependency graph information is used. The proposed model slightly outperforms state-of-the-art models on BEE over different datasets.</p></details> | 6 figures, 4 tables |
| **[Training Graph Neural Networks Using Non-Robust Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v6)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph -- structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are used to help improve the model's ability to correctly process data in noisy environments. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models -- GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE -- as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly sampled training sets of the same size from the original training set and the larger original full training set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-Fine Lightweight Meta-Embedding for ID-Based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11870v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The state-of-the-art recommendation systems have shifted the attention to efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory constraints. To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

This approach inherently involves large-scale distributed graph processing, which closely aligns with the challenges and research focuses of graph-based data systems. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from real-world applications, spanning various research backgrounds and settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 42 graph datasets from 18 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize different graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate the capabilities of FGL while also highlighting its potential limitations, providing valuable insights for future research in this growing field, particularly in fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration between FGL and data systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2025</p></details> |

While most of the earlier works address the complex nature of graph-structured data and predefined anomalies, the impact of data attributes and emerging anomalies are often neglected. This paper introduces DCOR, a novel approach on attributed networks that integrates reconstruction-based anomaly detection with Contrastive Learning. Utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, DCOR contrasts the reconstructed adjacency and feature matrices from both the original and augmented graphs to detect subtle anomalies. We employed comprehensive experimental studies on benchmark datasets through standard evaluation measures. The results show that DCOR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Spatio-temporal models combining mobility data with machine learning have gained attention for disease forecasting. Here, we explore Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) and Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GCLSTM), which combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with traditional architectures that deal with sequential data. The aim is to forecast future values of COVID-19 cases in Brazil and China by leveraging human mobility networks, whose nodes represent geographical locations and links are flows of vehicles or people. We show that employing backbone extraction to filter out negligible connections in the mobility network enhances predictive stability. Comparing regression and classification tasks demonstrates that binary classification yields smoother, more interpretable results. Interestingly, we observe qualitatively equivalent results for both Brazil and China datasets by introducing sliding windows of variable size and prediction horizons. Compared to prior studies, introducing the sliding window and the network backbone extraction strategies yields improvements of about 80% in root mean squared errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Defense Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11568v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate significant potential in various applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can greatly degrade their performance. Existing graph purification methods attempt to address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to effectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously due to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph data due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against adversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense Diffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the denoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial attacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding and removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their original structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1) Graph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph during the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains consistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained Regularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further enhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising strategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the model's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial attacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[UniGraph: Learning a Unified Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13630v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have revolutionized artificial intelligence, exhibiting remarkable abilities to generalize across a wide array of tasks and applications beyond their initial training objectives. However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Graph neural networks informed locally by thermodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13093v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multi-Party Dialogue Systems with Speaker-ware Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11292v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dialogue response generation has made significant progress, but most research has focused on dyadic dialogue. In contrast, multi-party dialogues involve more participants, each potentially discussing different topics, making the task more complex. Current methods often rely on graph neural networks to model dialogue context, which helps capture the structural dynamics of multi-party conversations. However, these methods are heavily dependent on intricate graph structures and dataset annotations, and they often overlook the distinct speaking styles of participants. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation model. CMR uses self-supervised contrastive learning to better distinguish "who says what." Additionally, by comparing speakers within the same conversation, the model captures differences in speaking styles and thematic transitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to apply contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results show that CMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in multi-party dialogue response tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast instance-specific algorithm configuration with graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11240v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are pivotal across various industrial applications, where the speed of solving these problems is crucial. Improving the performance of CO solvers across diverse input instances requires fine-tuning solver parameters for each instance. However, this tuning process is time-consuming, and the time required increases with the number of instances. To address this, a method called instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) has been devised. This approach involves two main steps: training and execution. During the training step, features are extracted from various instances and then grouped into clusters. For each cluster, parameters are fine-tuned. This cluster-specific tuning process results in a set of generalized parameters for instances belonging to each class. In the execution step, features are extracted from an unknown instance to determine its cluster, and the corresponding pre-tuned parameters are applied. Generally, the running time of a solver is evaluated by the time to solution ($TTS$). However, methods like ISAC require preprocessing. Therefore, the total execution time is $T_{tot}=TTS+T_{tune}$, where $T_{tune}$ represents the tuning time. While the goal is to minimize $T_{tot}$, it is important to note that extracting features in the ISAC method requires a certain amount of computational time. The extracting features include summary statistics of the solver execution logs, which takes several 10 seconds. This research presents a method to significantly reduce the time of the ISAC execution step by streamlining feature extraction and class determination with a graph neural network. Experimental results show that $T_{tune}$ in the execution step, which take several 10 seconds in the original ISAC manner, could be reduced to sub-seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spatial Disparity in Urban Prediction Using Residual-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: A Chicago Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11214v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban prediction tasks, such as forecasting traffic flow, temperature, and crime rates, are crucial for efficient urban planning and management. However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the model's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced predictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further illustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and demographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

In order to improve the perception ability of DRL on the network, some studies have combined graph neural networks (GNNs) with DRL, which use the GNNs to extract unstructured features of the network. However, as networks continue to evolve and become increasingly complex, existing GNN-DRL methods still face challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. Moreover, these methods are inadequate for addressing network security issues. From the perspective of security and robustness, this paper explores the solution of combining GNNs with DRL to build a resilient network. This article starts with a brief tutorial of GNNs and DRL, and introduces their existing applications in networks. Furthermore, we introduce the network security methods that can be strengthened by GNN-DRL approaches. Then, we designed a framework based on GNN-DRL to defend against attacks and enhance network resilience. Additionally, we conduct a case study using an encrypted traffic dataset collected from real IoT environments, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our framework. Finally, we highlight key open challenges and opportunities for enhancing network resilience with GNN-DRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Surrogates for Optimizing Transportation Policies with Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11057v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper presents a first approach of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as surrogates for large-scale agent-based simulation models. In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

The metaverse, envisioned as a parallel virtual world, requires seamless real-time experiences across diverse applications. The study introduces a software-defined networking (SDN)-based architecture and employs graph neural network (GNN) techniques for intelligent and adaptive task allocation in in-network computing (INC). Considering time constraints and computing capabilities, the proposed model optimally decides whether to offload rendering tasks to INC nodes or edge server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GNN model, achieving 97% accuracy compared to 72% for multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 70% for decision trees (DTs). The study fills the research gap in in-network placement for real-time metaverse applications, offering insights into efficient rendering task handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRID: Protecting Training Graph from Link Stealing Attacks on GNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10985v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts. By providing 1 to 25 annotated samples, our model, evaluated on a purely synthetic dataset depicting a truck-mounted loading crane, achieves effective segmentation across various levels of detail.

When benchmarked on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, it achieves a $J\&F$ score of 71.5 in semi-supervised video segmentation with three support samples. This method's fast training times and effective generalization to real data make it a valuable tool for autonomous systems interacting with machinery and infrastructure, and illustrate the potential of combined and orchestrated foundation models for few-shot segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

While traditional spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in short-term traffic forecasting, their performance in long-term predictions remains limited. This challenge arises from over-squashing problem, where bottlenecks and limited receptive fields restrict information flow and hinder the modeling of global dependencies. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework that incorporates virtual nodes, which are additional nodes added to the graph and connected to existing nodes, in order to aggregate information across the entire graph within a single GNN layer. Our proposed model incorporates virtual nodes by constructing a semi-adaptive adjacency matrix. This matrix integrates distance-based and adaptive adjacency matrices, allowing the model to leverage geographical information while also learning task-specific features from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of virtual nodes significantly enhances long-term prediction accuracy while also improving layer-wise sensitivity to mitigate the over-squashing problem. Virtual nodes also offer enhanced explainability by focusing on key intersections and high-traffic areas, as shown by the visualization of their adjacency matrix weights on road network heat maps. Our advanced approach enhances the understanding and management of urban traffic systems, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Representations and Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08305v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods. The code of the proposed benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CVI-yangwn/Benchmark-GNN-for-Multivariate-Time-Series-Classification}.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/JasonZhujp/RELIEF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025 (camera-ready version).

Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are employed to discretely and accurately represent the geometry of 3D conducting bodies. A concise and informative graph representation is then constructed by treating each RWG function as a node in the graph, enabling the flow of current between nodes. With the transformed graphs, GraphSolver is developed to directly predict real and imaginary parts of the x, y and z components of the surface current densities at each node (RWG function). Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSolver in solving CFIEs for 3D conducting bodies with varying levels of geometric complexity, including basic 3D targets, missile-shaped targets, and airplane-shaped targets.</p></details> | 10 pages,11 figures |

By leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric framework, BN-Pool employs a generative model capable of partitioning graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters. During training, we learn the node-to-cluster assignments by combining the supervised loss of the downstream task with an unsupervised auxiliary term, which encourages the reconstruction of the original graph topology while penalizing unnecessary proliferation of clusters. This adaptive strategy allows BN-Pool to automatically discover an optimal coarsening level, offering enhanced flexibility and removing the need to specify sensitive pooling ratios. We show that BN-Pool achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

One common approach is to use Dijkstra's Algorithm, which produces the shortest path as well as the shortest distance. However, this option is computationally expensive when applied to large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel fast framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) which approximate the single-source shortest distance between pairs of locations, and predict the single-source shortest path subsequently. We conduct multiple experiments on synthetic graphs of different size to demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed model. In real-world case studies, we also applied the proposed method of flood risk analysis of coastal urban areas to calculate delays in evacuation to public shelters during hurricanes. The results indicate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the GNN model, and its potential for effective implementation in emergency planning and management.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022)</p></details> |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast Searching of Extreme Operating Conditions for Relay Protection Setting Calculation Based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09399v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for the Extreme Operating Conditions (EOCs) is one of the core problems of power system relay protection setting calculation. The current methods based on brute-force search, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming can hardly meet the requirements of today's power systems in terms of computation speed due to the drastic changes in operating conditions induced by renewables and power electronics. This paper proposes an EOC fast search method, named Graph Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Graph D3QN), which combines graph neural network and deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. First, the EOC search problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, where the information of the underlying power system is extracted using graph neural networks, so that the EOC of the system can be found via deep reinforcement learning. Then, a two-stage Guided Learning and Free Exploration (GLFE) training framework is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of reinforcement learning. Finally, the proposed Graph D3QN method is validated through case studies of searching maximum fault current for relay protection setting calculation on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph D3QN can reduce the computation time by 10 to 1000 times while guaranteeing the accuracy of the selected EOCs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

In this work we equip its enumeration-based instantiation with a neural network that guides the choice of the quantified formulas and their instances. For that we develop a relatively fast graph neural network that repeatedly scores all available instantiation options with respect to the available formulas. The network runs directly on a CPU without the need for any special hardware. We train the neural guidance on a large set of proofs generated by the e-matching instantiation strategy and evaluate its performance on a set of previously unseen problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Overfitting in Graph Neural Networks via Feature and Hyperplane Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15081v8)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used in semi-supervised settings. Previous research has primarily focused on finding appropriate graph filters (e.g. aggregation methods) to perform well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. While these methods are effective, they can still suffer from the sparsity of node features, where the initial data contain few non-zero elements. This can lead to overfitting in certain dimensions in the first projection matrix, as training samples may not cover the entire range of graph filters (hyperplanes). To address this, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. Specifically, by flipping both the initial features and hyperplane, we create additional space for training, which leads to more precise updates of the learnable parameters and improved robustness for unseen features during inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the overfitting caused by the initial features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed technique increases node classification accuracy by up to 46.5% relatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Accpected by AAAI2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks, the dominant approach for graph representation learning, are limited in their representation power. Therefore, it can be beneficial to explicitly extract and incorporate high-order topological and geometric information into these models. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to extract the rich connectivity information of graphs based on the theory of persistent homology. Our method utilizes the topological features to enhance the representation learning of graph neural networks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and link prediction benchmarks. We also explore the option of end-to-end learning of the topological features, i.e., treating topological computation as a differentiable operator during learning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study provide insights and potential guidelines for employing topological features in graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in JMLR 2025</p></details> |

In our research, we develop an innovative surrogate model for a traffic assignment when multi-class vehicles are involved. We do so by employing heterogeneous graph neural networks which use a multiple-view graph attention mechanism tailored to different vehicle classes, along with additional links connecting origin-destination pairs. We also integrate the node-based flow conservation law into the loss function. As a result, our model adheres to flow conservation while delivering highly accurate predictions for link flows and utilization ratios. Through numerical experiments conducted on urban transportation networks, we demonstrate that our model surpasses traditional neural network approaches in convergence speed and predictive accuracy in both user equilibrium and system optimal versions of traffic assignment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Similarity-Quantized Relative Learning (SQRL), a learning framework that reformulates molecular activity prediction as relative difference learning between structurally similar pairs of compounds. SQRL uses precomputed molecular similarities to enhance training of graph neural networks and other architectures, and significantly improves accuracy and generalization in low-data regimes common in drug discovery. We demonstrate its broad applicability and real-world potential through benchmarking on public datasets as well as proprietary industry data. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging similarity-aware relative differences provides an effective paradigm for molecular activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transactions on Communications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.16187</p></details> |

To overcome this, we have developed GRAPPA - a hybrid graph neural network for predicting vapor pressures of pure components. GRAPPA enables the prediction of the vapor pressure curve of basically any organic molecule, requiring only the molecular structure as input. The new model consists of three parts: A graph attention network for the message passing step, a pooling function that captures long-range interactions, and a prediction head that yields the component-specific parameters of the Antoine equation, from which the vapor pressure can readily and consistently be calculated for any temperature. We have trained and evaluated GRAPPA on experimental vapor pressure data of almost 25,000 pure components. We found excellent prediction accuracy for unseen components, outperforming state-of-the-art group contribution methods and other machine learning approaches in applicability and accuracy. The trained model and its code are fully disclosed, and GRAPPA is directly applicable via the interactive website ml-prop.mv.rptu.de.</p></details> | 38 pages, 12 figures |

However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

Within this context, adaptive spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNNs) have emerged as valuable tools for modelling these dependencies, especially through a data-driven approach rather than pre-defined spatial graphs. While this approach offers higher accuracy, it presents increased computational demands. Addressing this challenge, this paper delves into the concept of localisation within ASTGNNs, introducing an innovative perspective that spatial dependencies should be dynamically evolving over time. We introduce \textit{DynAGS}, a localised ASTGNN framework aimed at maximising efficiency and accuracy in distributed deployment. This framework integrates dynamic localisation, time-evolving spatial graphs, and personalised localisation, all orchestrated around the Dynamic Graph Generator, a light-weighted central module leveraging cross attention. The central module can integrate historical information in a node-independent manner to enhance the feature representation of nodes at the current moment. This improved feature representation is then used to generate a dynamic sparse graph without the need for costly data exchanges, and it supports personalised localisation. Performance assessments across two core ASTGNN architectures and nine real-world datasets from various applications reveal that \textit{DynAGS} outshines current benchmarks, underscoring that the dynamic modelling of spatial dependencies can drastically improve model expressibility, flexibility, and system efficiency, especially in distributed settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by KDD'25</p></details> |

However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

However, most existing GNNs rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain knowledge. In this paper, we first analyze the restrictions of GNNs generalization from the perspective of supervision signals in the context of few-shot semi-supervised node classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm named NormProp, which utilizes the homophily assumption of unlabeled nodes to generate additional supervision signals, thereby enhancing the generalization against label scarcity. The key idea is to efficiently capture both the class information and the consistency of aggregation during message passing, via decoupling the direction and Euclidean norm of node representations. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical analysis to determine the upper bound of Euclidean norm, and then propose homophilous regularization to constraint the consistency of unlabeled nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NormProp achieve state-of-the-art performance under low-label rate scenarios with low computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, serving GNNs on large graphs is challenging due to the high communication, computation, and memory overheads of constructing and executing computation graphs, which represent information flow across large neighborhoods. Existing approximation techniques in training can mitigate the overheads but, in serving, still lead to high latency and/or accuracy loss. To this end, we propose OMEGA, a system that enables low-latency GNN serving for large graphs with minimal accuracy loss through two key ideas. First, OMEGA employs selective recomputation of precomputed embeddings, which allows for reusing precomputed computation subgraphs while selectively recomputing a small fraction to minimize accuracy loss. Second, we develop computation graph parallelism, which reduces communication overhead by parallelizing the creation and execution of computation graphs across machines. Our evaluation with large graph datasets and GNN models shows that OMEGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on "reach-avoid derived" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods.</p></details> |  |

Temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such category of specialized models. For the first time, our approach integrates a reject option strategy within the framework of GNNs for continuous-time dynamic graphs. This allows the model to strategically abstain from making predictions when the uncertainty is high and confidence is low, thus minimizing the risk of critical misclassification and enhancing the results and reliability. We propose a coverage-based abstention prediction model to implement the reject option that maximizes prediction within a specified coverage. It improves the prediction score for link prediction and node classification tasks. Temporal GNNs deal with extremely skewed datasets for the next state prediction or node classification task. In the case of class imbalance, our method can be further tuned to provide a higher weightage to the minority class. Exhaustive experiments are presented on four datasets for dynamic link prediction and two datasets for dynamic node classification tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reliability and area under the curve (AUC)/ average precision (AP) scores for predictions in dynamic graph scenarios. The results highlight our model's ability to efficiently handle the trade-offs between prediction confidence and coverage, making it a dependable solution for applications requiring high precision in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed model fuses ResNet-extracted image embeddings with shape embeddings from a bespoke graph neural network. The shape embeddings are derived from surface meshes of 15 brain structures, capturing detailed geometric information. Combined with the appearance features from T1-weighted images, we observe improvements in the prediction performance on both tasks, with substantial gains for classification.

| **[Double Equivariance for Inductive Link Prediction for Both New Nodes and New Relation Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01313v8)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of fully inductive link prediction in knowledge graphs has gained significant attention, with various graph neural networks being proposed to address it. This task presents greater challenges than traditional inductive link prediction tasks with only new nodes, as models must be capable of zero-shot generalization to both unseen nodes and unseen relation types in the inference graph. Despite the development of novel models, a unifying theoretical understanding of their success remains elusive, and the limitations of these methods are not well-studied. In this work, we introduce the concept of double permutation-equivariant representations and demonstrate its necessity for effective performance in this task. We show that many existing models, despite their diverse architectural designs, conform to this framework. However, we also identify inherent limitations in double permutation-equivariant representations, which restrict these models's ability to learn effectively on datasets with varying characteristics. Our findings suggest that while double equivariance is necessary for meta-learning across knowledge graphs from different domains, it is not sufficient. There remains a fundamental gap between double permutation-equivariant models and the concept of foundation models designed to learn patterns across all domains.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework for Recognizing User Emotions in Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07746v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of social media platforms has provided unprecedented access to massive amounts of multimodal user-generated content. Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing.</p></details> |  |

There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions.

Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |

By semantically blinding the model to information about specific words, it is robust to social biases such as political or gender bias that have been plaguing previous machine learning-based SA systems. The SProp GNN shows performance superior to lexicon-based alternatives such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and EmoAtlas on two different prediction tasks, and across two languages. Additionally, it approaches the accuracy of transformer-based models while significantly reducing bias in emotion prediction tasks. By offering improved explainability and reducing bias, the SProp GNN bridges the methodological gap between interpretable lexicon approaches and powerful, yet often opaque, deep learning models, offering a robust tool for fair and effective emotion analysis in understanding human behavior through text.</p></details> |  |

While many existing studies improve fairness at the group level, only a few works promote individual fairness, which renders similar outcomes for similar individuals. A desirable framework that promotes individual fairness should (1) balance between fairness and performance, (2) accommodate two commonly-used individual similarity measures (externally annotated and computed from input features), (3) generalize across various GNN models, and (4) be computationally efficient. Unfortunately, none of the prior work achieves all the desirables. In this work, we propose a novel method, GFairHint, which promotes individual fairness in GNNs and achieves all aforementioned desirables. GFairHint learns fairness representations through an auxiliary link prediction task, and then concatenates the representations with the learned node embeddings in original GNNs as a "fairness hint". Through extensive experimental investigations on five real-world graph datasets under three prevalent GNN models covering both individual similarity measures above, GFairHint achieves the best fairness results in almost all combinations of datasets with various backbone models, while generating comparable utility results, with much less computational cost compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Duplex: Dual Prototype Learning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07114v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to enable models to recognize novel compositions of visual states and objects that were absent during training. Existing methods predominantly focus on learning semantic representations of seen compositions but often fail to disentangle the independent features of states and objects in images, thereby limiting their ability to generalize to unseen compositions. To address this challenge, we propose Duplex, a novel dual-prototype learning method that integrates semantic and visual prototypes through a carefully designed dual-branch architecture, enabling effective representation learning for compositional tasks. Duplex utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to adaptively update visual prototypes, capturing complex interactions between states and objects. Additionally, it leverages the strong visual-semantic alignment of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a multi-path architecture combined with prompt engineering to align image and text representations, ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Duplex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed-world and open-world settings.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed \emph{PropEnc}, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. \emph{PropEnc} leverages histogram construction combined with reversed index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. \emph{PropEnc} allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively address the sparsity challenge and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that \emph{PropEnc} is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</p></details> | conference paper |

Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to model stealing attacks when deployed within Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) necessitates robust Ownership Demonstration (OD) techniques. Watermarking is a promising OD framework for Deep Neural Networks, but existing methods fail to generalize to GNNs due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data. Previous works on GNN watermarking have primarily focused on node and graph classification, overlooking Link Prediction (LP). In this paper, we propose GENIE (watermarking Graph nEural Networks for lInk prEdiction), the first-ever scheme to watermark GNNs for LP. GENIE creates a novel backdoor for both node-representation and subgraph-based LP methods, utilizing a unique trigger set and a secret watermark vector. Our OD scheme is equipped with Dynamic Watermark Thresholding (DWT), ensuring high verification probability (>99.99%) while addressing practical issues in existing watermarking schemes. We extensively evaluate GENIE across 4 model architectures (i.e., SEAL, GCN, GraphSAGE and NeoGNN) and 7 real-world datasets. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of GENIE against 11 state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques and 3 model extraction attacks. We also show GENIE's resilience against ownership piracy attacks. Finally, we discuss a defense strategy to counter adaptive attacks against GENIE.</p></details> |  |

While existing transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction, their high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their practicality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To address these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock return prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph neural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by utilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity.

| **[Dual-Modality Representation Learning for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06608v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction has attracted substantial attention recently. Accurate prediction of drug properties relies heavily on effective molecular representations. The structures of chemical compounds are commonly represented as graphs or SMILES sequences. Recent advances in learning drug properties commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on the graph representation. For the SMILES representation, Transformer-based architectures have been adopted by treating each SMILES string as a sequence of tokens. Because each representation has its own advantages and disadvantages, combining both representations in learning drug properties is a promising direction. We propose a method named Dual-Modality Cross-Attention (DMCA) that can effectively combine the strengths of two representations by employing the cross-attention mechanism. DMCA was evaluated across eight datasets including both classification and regression tasks. Results show that our method achieves the best overall performance, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging the complementary information from both graph and SMILES modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Computational Capability of Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Bound Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06444v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the standard approach for learning and reasoning over relational data, leveraging the message-passing mechanism that iteratively propagates node embeddings through graph structures. While GNNs have achieved significant empirical success, their theoretical limitations remain an active area of research. Existing studies primarily focus on characterizing GNN expressiveness through Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism tests. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach by exploring the computational limitations of GNNs through the lens of circuit complexity. Specifically, we analyze the circuit complexity of common GNN architectures and prove that under constraints of constant-depth layers, linear or sublinear embedding sizes, and polynomial precision, GNNs cannot solve key problems such as graph connectivity and graph isomorphism unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$. These results reveal the intrinsic expressivity limitations of GNNs behind their empirical success and introduce a novel framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness that can be extended to a broader range of GNN models and graph decision problems.</p></details> |  |

Recent attention has pivoted towards more intricate structures, encompassing (1) static heterophilic graphs encountering the edge heterophily issue in the spatial domain and (2) event-based continuous graphs in the temporal domain. State-of-the-art (SOTA) has been concurrently addressing these two lines of work but tends to overlook the presence of heterophily in the temporal domain, constituting the temporal heterophily issue. Furthermore, we highlight that the edge heterophily issue and the temporal heterophily issue often co-exist in event-based continuous graphs, giving rise to the temporal edge heterophily challenge. To tackle this challenge, this paper first introduces the temporal edge heterophily measurement. Subsequently, we propose the Temporal Heterophilic Graph Convolutional Network (THeGCN), an innovative model that incorporates the low/high-pass graph signal filtering technique to accurately capture both edge (spatial) heterophily and temporal heterophily. Specifically, the THeGCN model consists of two key components: a sampler and an aggregator. The sampler selects events relevant to a node at a given moment. Then, the aggregator executes message-passing, encoding temporal information, node attributes, and edge attributes into node embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 real-world datasets validate the efficacy of THeGCN.</p></details> |  |

Despite their empirical success, many research efforts focus on the theoretical limitations of GNNs, i.e., the GNNs expressive power. Early works in this domain mainly focus on studying the graph isomorphism recognition ability of GNNs, and recent works try to leverage the properties such as subgraph counting and connectivity learning to characterize the expressive power of GNNs, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for models for enhancing expressive power under different forms of definition. Concretely, the models are reviewed based on three categories, i.e., Graph feature enhancement, Graph topology enhancement, and GNNs architecture enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeltaGNN: Graph Neural Network with Information Flow Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06002v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular deep learning models designed to process graph-structured data through recursive neighborhood aggregations in the message passing process. When applied to semi-supervised node classification, the message-passing enables GNNs to understand short-range spatial interactions, but also causes them to suffer from over-smoothing and over-squashing. These challenges hinder model expressiveness and prevent the use of deeper models to capture long-range node interactions (LRIs) within the graph. Popular solutions for LRIs detection are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time complexity or fail to generalize across diverse graph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a mechanism called \emph{information flow control}, which leverages a novel connectivity measure, called \emph{information flow score}, to address over-smoothing and over-squashing with linear computational overhead, supported by theoretical evidence. Finally, to prove the efficacy of our methodology we design DeltaGNN, the first scalable and generalizable approach for detecting long-range and short-range interactions. We benchmark our model across 10 real-world datasets, including graphs with varying sizes, topologies, densities, and homophilic ratios, showing superior performance with limited computational complexity. The implementation of the proposed methods are publicly available at https://github.com/basiralab/DeltaGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Heterogeneous Network learning with Non-Recursive Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07598v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) can be used to model various real-world systems. As HINs consist of multiple types of nodes, edges, and node features, it is nontrivial to directly apply graph neural network (GNN) techniques in heterogeneous cases. There are two remaining major challenges. First, homogeneous message passing in a recursive manner neglects the distinct types of nodes and edges in different hops, leading to unnecessary information mixing. This often results in the incorporation of ``noise'' from uncorrelated intermediate neighbors, thereby degrading performance. Second, feature learning should be handled differently for different types, which is challenging especially when the type sizes are large. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel framework - AutoGNR, to directly utilize and automatically extract effective heterogeneous information. Instead of recursive homogeneous message passing, we introduce a non-recursive message passing mechanism for GNN to mitigate noise from uncorrelated node types in HINs. Furthermore, under the non-recursive framework, we manage to efficiently perform neural architecture search for an optimal GNN structure in a differentiable way, which can automatically define the heterogeneous paths for aggregation. Our tailored search space encompasses more effective candidates while maintaining a tractable size. Experiments show that AutoGNR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both normal and large scale real-world HIN datasets.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been recently adapted to solve combinatorial problems, showing competitive results and potentially high scalability due to their distributed nature. We propose a merging approach that aims at retaining both the accuracy exhibited by AMs and the representational flexibility and scalability of GNNs. Our model considers a compression step, followed by a supervised interaction where partial solutions obtained from the AM are used to guide local GNNs from where node feature representations are obtained and combined to initialize an additional GNN-based solver that handles the original graph's target problem. Intuitively, the AM can solve the combinatorial problem indirectly by infusing its knowledge into the GNN. Experiments on canonical optimization problems show that the idea is feasible, effectively allowing the AM to solve size problems beyond its original limits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Machine Learning with New Compute Paradigms at NeurIPS 2024 (MLNCP 2024)</p></details> |

However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, which can lead the model to misclassify graphs with attached triggers as the target class. The effectiveness of recent promising defense techniques, such as fine-tuning or distillation, is heavily contingent on having comprehensive knowledge of the sufficient training dataset. Empirical studies have shown that fine-tuning methods require a clean dataset of 20% to reduce attack accuracy to below 25%, while distillation methods require a clean dataset of 15%. However, obtaining such a large amount of clean data is commonly impractical. In this paper, we propose a practical backdoor mitigation framework, denoted as GRAPHNAD, which can capture high-quality intermediate-layer representations in GNNs to enhance the distillation process with limited clean data. To achieve this, we address the following key questions: How to identify the appropriate attention representations in graphs for distillation? How to enhance distillation with limited data? By adopting the graph attention transfer method, GRAPHNAD can effectively align the intermediate-layer attention representations of the backdoored model with that of the teacher model, forcing the backdoor neurons to transform into benign ones. Besides, we extract the relation maps from intermediate-layer transformation and enforce the relation maps of the backdoored model to be consistent with that of the teacher model, thereby ensuring model accuracy while further reducing the influence of backdoors. Extensive experimental results show that by fine-tuning a teacher model with only 3% of the clean data, GRAPHNAD can reduce the attack success rate to below 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |
