| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models on Graphs: An Analysis on Cross-Dataset Transfer of Pretrained GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17609v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To develop a preliminary understanding towards Graph Foundation Models, we study the extent to which pretrained Graph Neural Networks can be applied across datasets, an effort requiring to be agnostic to dataset-specific features and their encodings. We build upon a purely structural pretraining approach and propose an extension to capture feature information while still being feature-agnostic. We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data. Feature information can lead to improvements, but currently requires some similarities between pretraining and downstream feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the NeurIPS 2024 workshop "Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations" (NeuReps 2024)</p></details> |
| **[IOHunter: Graph Foundation Model to Uncover Online Information Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14663v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have become vital spaces for public discourse, serving as modern agor\'as where a wide range of voices influence societal narratives. However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[GraphMoRE: Mitigating Topological Heterogeneity via Mixture of Riemannian Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11085v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs have inherently complex and diverse topological patterns, known as topological heterogeneity. Most existing works learn graph representation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to match the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with high distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph foundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of diverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains the possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product manifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for representing the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively tackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry pattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we propose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space for each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned gating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes, effectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying curvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise distances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and effective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower distortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with topological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Study on the Generalization of Positional and Structural Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07407v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in integrating positional and structural encodings (PSEs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced their performance across various graph learning tasks. However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Topology Only Pre-Training: Towards Generalised Multi-Domain Graph Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03976v4)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The principal benefit of unsupervised representation learning is that a pre-trained model can be fine-tuned where data or labels are scarce. Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

| **[GFT: Graph Foundation Model with Transferable Tree Vocabulary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06070v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of foundation models in applications such as ChatGPT, as graph data has been ubiquitous, one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) with broader applications in the areas such as scientific research, social network analysis, drug discovery, and e-commerce. Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning. The open source code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Training of Trustworthy and Energy-Efficient Predictive Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12909v4)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present our work on developing and training scalable, trustworthy, and energy-efficient predictive graph foundation models (GFMs) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier.</p></details> | 51 pages, 32 figures |
| **[GraphCLIP: Enhancing Transferability in Graph Foundation Models for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10329v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

| **[TAGLAS: An atlas of text-attributed graph datasets in the era of large graph and language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14683v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we present TAGLAS, an atlas of text-attributed graph (TAG) datasets and benchmarks. TAGs are graphs with node and edge features represented in text, which have recently gained wide applicability in training graph-language or graph foundation models. In TAGLAS, we collect and integrate more than 23 TAG datasets with domains ranging from citation graphs to molecule graphs and tasks from node classification to graph question-answering. Unlike previous graph datasets and benchmarks, all datasets in TAGLAS have a unified node and edge text feature format, which allows a graph model to be simultaneously trained and evaluated on multiple datasets from various domains. Further, we provide a standardized, efficient, and simplified way to load all datasets and tasks. We also provide useful utils like text-to-embedding conversion, and graph-to-text conversion, which can facilitate different evaluation scenarios. Finally, we also provide standard and easy-to-use evaluation utils. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/TAGLAS and is still under construction. Please expect more datasets/features in the future.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[LangGFM: A Large Language Model Alone Can be a Powerful Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14961v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently gained significant attention. However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: The Perspective of Zero-shot Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12609v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of artificial general intelligence, there is a trend towards developing Graph Foundation Models that excel in generalization across various graph tasks and domains. However, current models often require extensive training or fine-tuning to capture structural and semantic insights on new graphs, which limits their versatility. In this work, we explore graph foundation models from the perspective of zero-shot reasoning on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our focus is on utilizing KGs as a unified topological structure to tackle diverse tasks, while addressing semantic isolation challenges in KG reasoning to effectively integrate diverse semantic and structural features. This brings us new methodological insights into KG reasoning, as well as high generalizability towards foundation models in practice. Methodologically, we introduce SCORE, a unified graph reasoning framework that effectively generalizes diverse graph tasks using zero-shot learning. At the core of SCORE is semantic conditional message passing, a technique designed to capture both structural and semantic invariances in graphs, with theoretical backing for its expressive power. Practically, we evaluate the zero-shot reasoning capability of SCORE using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance improvement over prior foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Prompt-Based Knowledge Graph Foundation Model for Universal In-Context Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12288v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive knowledge graphs (KGs) have been constructed to facilitate knowledge-driven tasks across various scenarios. However, existing work usually develops separate reasoning models for different KGs, lacking the ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across diverse KGs and reasoning settings. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

| **[Enhance Graph Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11370v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[OpenGraph: Towards Open Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01121v4)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has become essential in various domains, including recommendation systems and social network analysis. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'2024</p></details> |
| **[Range-aware Positional Encoding via High-order Pretraining: Theory and Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19117v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised pre-training on vast amounts of graph data is critical in real-world applications wherein labeled data is limited, such as molecule properties prediction or materials science. Existing approaches pre-train models for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within networks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised tasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that focuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us to capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local structures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding (WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order Permutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node connectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing positional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input graph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on graphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also domain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore paving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph foundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a parametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency up to arbitrarily low error. We also evaluate HOPE-WavePE on graph-level prediction tasks of different areas and show its superiority compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Neural Scaling Laws Exist on Graph Self-Supervised Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11243v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyGraph: Graph Foundation Model in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10700v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing ubiquity of relational data structured as graphs has underscored the need for graph learning models with exceptional generalization capabilities. However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Self-Supervised Graph Foundation Models: Knowledge-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16137v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) is now a go-to method for pre-training graph foundation models (GFMs). There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks.

| **[GraphFM: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Graph Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOFA: A Generative One-For-All Model for Joint Graph Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09709v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/GOFA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14899v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the structure of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. We believe our computed embeddings will support the emerging field of graph foundation models. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction suggest that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

Graph-structured data often lacks the same scale as unstructured data, making the development of graph foundation models challenging. In this work, we propose Foundation-Informed Message Passing (FIMP), a Graph Neural Network (GNN) message-passing framework that leverages pretrained non-textual foundation models in graph-based tasks. We show that the self-attention layers of foundation models can effectively be repurposed on graphs to perform cross-node attention-based message-passing. Our model is evaluated on a real-world image network dataset and two biological applications (single-cell RNA sequencing data and fMRI brain activity recordings) in both finetuned and zero-shot settings. FIMP outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that it can effectively leverage state-of-the-art foundation models in graph tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (12 + 4 pages appendix). 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models to generalize and adapt motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> |  |

This is highlighted by the generative capabilities of NLP models like GPT-4, and the retrieval-based approaches of CV models like CLIP, both of which effectively bridge the gap between seen and unseen data. In the realm of graph learning, the continuous emergence of new graphs and the challenges of human labeling also amplify the necessity for zero-shot transfer learning, driving the exploration of approaches that can generalize across diverse graph data without necessitating dataset-specific and label-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we extend such paradigms to zero-shot transferability in graphs by introducing ZeroG, a new framework tailored to enable cross-dataset generalization. Addressing the inherent challenges such as feature misalignment, mismatched label spaces, and negative transfer, we leverage a language model to encode both node attributes and class semantics, ensuring consistent feature dimensions across datasets. We also propose a prompt-based subgraph sampling module that enriches the semantic information and structure information of extracted subgraphs using prompting nodes and neighborhood aggregation, respectively. We further adopt a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that reduces the risk of overfitting and maintains the zero-shot learning efficacy of the language model. The results underscore the effectiveness of our model in achieving significant cross-dataset zero-shot transferability, opening pathways for the development of graph foundation models.

One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach. By successfully leveraging the synergistic potential of multiple graph datasets for pretraining, our work stands as a pioneering contribution to the realm of graph foundational model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD'24, August 25-29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark providing novel text-space datasets and comprehensive evaluation under unified problem settings.

| **[GraphFM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08310v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) serve as a general class for the development of artificial intelligence systems, offering broad potential for generalization across a spectrum of downstream tasks. Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Graph Foundation Models are Already Here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are emerging as a significant research topic in the graph domain, aiming to develop graph models trained on extensive and diverse data to enhance their applicability across various tasks and domains. Developing GFMs presents unique challenges over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are typically trained from scratch for specific tasks on particular datasets. The primary challenge in constructing GFMs lies in effectively leveraging vast and diverse graph data to achieve positive transfer. Drawing inspiration from existing foundation models in the CV and NLP domains, we propose a novel perspective for the GFM development by advocating for a ``graph vocabulary'', in which the basic transferable units underlying graphs encode the invariance on graphs. We ground the graph vocabulary construction from essential aspects including network analysis, expressiveness, and stability. Such a vocabulary perspective can potentially advance the future GFM design in line with the neural scaling laws. All relevant resources with GFM design can be found here.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models for Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07478v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions. In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs). While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval. In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization. Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types. To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity. To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data. Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.</p></details> |  |

With the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) reporting an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities, the traditional manual analysis becomes untenably time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper introduces VulnScopper, an innovative approach that utilizes multi-modal representation learning, combining Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to automate and enhance the analysis of software vulnerabilities. Leveraging ULTRA, a knowledge graph foundation model, combined with a Large Language Model (LLM), VulnScopper effectively handles unseen entities, overcoming the limitations of previous KG approaches. We evaluate VulnScopper on two major security datasets, the NVD and the Red Hat CVE database. Our method significantly improves the link prediction accuracy between Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs), and Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs). Our results show that VulnScopper outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 78% Hits@10 accuracy in linking CVEs to CPEs and CWEs and presenting an 11.7% improvement over large language models in predicting CWE labels based on the Red Hat database. Based on the NVD, only 6.37% of the linked CPEs are being published during the first 30 days; many of them are related to critical and high-risk vulnerabilities which, according to multiple compliance frameworks (such as CISA and PCI), should be remediated within 15-30 days. Our model can uncover new products linked to vulnerabilities, reducing remediation time and improving vulnerability management. We analyzed several CVEs from 2023 to showcase this ability.</p></details> |  |

Our model transforms each graph or sampled subgraph into a sequence of tokens representing the node, edge and attributes reversibly using the Eulerian path first. Then we feed the tokens into a standard transformer decoder and pre-train it with the next-token-prediction (NTP) task. Lastly, we fine-tune the GraphGPT model with the supervised tasks. This intuitive, yet effective model achieves superior or close results to the state-of-the-art methods for the graph-, edge- and node-level tasks on the large scale molecular dataset PCQM4Mv2, the protein-protein association dataset ogbl-ppa and the ogbn-proteins dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Furthermore, the generative pre-training enables us to train GraphGPT up to 400M+ parameters with consistently increasing performance, which is beyond the capability of GNNs and previous graph transformers. The source code and pre-trained checkpoints will be released soon\footnote{\url{https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt}} to pave the way for the graph foundation model research, and also to assist the scientific discovery in pharmaceutical, chemistry, material and bio-informatics domains, etc.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

| **[Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174v2)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p></details> | Preprint, 25 pages |

While recent advancements in "graph pre-training and prompt tuning" have reduced label dependence in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and improved their generalization abilities by leveraging pre-training knowledge, these efforts have focused exclusively on unsigned graphs. The scarcity of publicly available signed graph datasets makes it essential to transfer knowledge from unsigned graphs to signed graph tasks. However, this transfer introduces significant challenges due to the graph-level and task-level divergences between the pre-training and downstream phases. To address these challenges, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT) in this paper. Specifically, SGPT employs a graph template and a semantic prompt to segregate mixed link semantics in the signed graph and then adaptively integrate the distinctive semantic information according to the needs of downstream tasks, thereby unifying the pre-training and downstream graphs. Additionally, SGPT utilizes a task template and a feature prompt to reformulate the downstream signed graph tasks, aligning them with pre-training tasks to ensure a unified optimization objective and consistent feature space across tasks. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on popular signed graph datasets, demonstrating the superiority of SGPT over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17676v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph representation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the performance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an end-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTheft: Quantifying Privacy Risks in Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14718v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) represents an innovative approach in graph representation learning, enabling task-specific adaptations by fine-tuning prompts without altering the underlying pre-trained model. Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally focus on a single graph object type (node, edge, graph, etc.) and often overlook the inherent connections among different object types of graph anomalies. For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an abnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this, we present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node, edge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh Quotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by transferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We theoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy of subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant anomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a novel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels, adjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting training goals. Comprehensive experiments show that UniGAD outperforms both existing GAD methods specialized for a single task and graph prompt-based approaches for multiple tasks, while also providing robust zero-shot task transferability.

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

| **[Prompt-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have proven efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Against Multifaceted Graph Heterogeneity via Asymmetric Federated Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02003v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to collaboratively and privately optimize graph models on divergent data for different tasks. A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472v5)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug combinations can cause adverse drug-drug interactions(DDIs). Identifying specific effects is crucial for developing safer therapies. Previous works on DDI event prediction have typically been limited to using labels of specific events as supervision, which renders them insufficient to address two significant challenges: (1) the bias caused by \textbf{highly imbalanced event distribution} where certain interaction types are vastly under-represented. (2) the \textbf{scarcity of labeled data for rare events}, a pervasive issue where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-explored due to limited available data. In response, we offer ``DDIPrompt'', an innovative solution inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompt learning. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt features a hierarchical pre-training strategy to foster a generalized and comprehensive understanding of drug properties. It captures intra-molecular structures through augmented links based on structural proximity between drugs, further learns inter-molecular interactions emphasizing edge connections rather than concrete catagories. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate DDIPrompt's SOTA performance, especially for those rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCLIP: Enhancing Transferability in Graph Foundation Models for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10329v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

| **[Reliable and Compact Graph Fine-tuning via GraphSparse Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21749v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph prompt learning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. However, existing works generally conduct prompting over all graph elements (e.g., nodes, edges, node attributes, etc.), which is suboptimal and obviously redundant. To address this issue, we propose exploiting sparse representation theory for graph prompting and present Graph Sparse Prompting (GSP). GSP aims to adaptively and sparsely select the optimal elements (e.g., certain node attributes) to achieve compact prompting for downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose two kinds of GSP models, termed Graph Sparse Feature Prompting (GSFP) and Graph Sparse multi-Feature Prompting (GSmFP). Both GSFP and GSmFP provide a general scheme for tuning any specific pre-trained GNNs that can achieve attribute selection and compact prompt learning simultaneously. A simple yet effective algorithm has been designed for solving GSFP and GSmFP models. Experiments on 16 widely-used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSFPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10341v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Coordinators and Prompts on Heterogeneous Graphs for Cross-Domain Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11719v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the online digital world, users frequently engage with diverse items across multiple domains (e.g., e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and social media networks), forming complex heterogeneous interaction graphs. Leveraging this multi-domain information can undoubtedly enhance the performance of recommendation systems by providing more comprehensive user insights and alleviating data sparsity in individual domains. However, integrating multi-domain knowledge for the cross-domain recommendation is very hard due to inherent disparities in user behavior and item characteristics and the risk of negative transfer, where irrelevant or conflicting information from the source domains adversely impacts the target domain's performance. To address these challenges, we offer HAGO, a novel framework with $\textbf{H}$eterogeneous $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{G}$raph co$\textbf{O}$rdinators, which dynamically integrate multi-domain graphs into a cohesive structure by adaptively adjusting the connections between coordinators and multi-domain graph nodes, thereby enhancing beneficial inter-domain interactions while mitigating negative transfer effects. Additionally, we develop a universal multi-domain graph pre-training strategy alongside HAGO to collaboratively learn high-quality node representations across domains. To effectively transfer the learned multi-domain knowledge to the target domain, we design an effective graph prompting method, which incorporates pre-trained embeddings with learnable prompts for the recommendation task. Our framework is compatible with various graph-based models and pre-training techniques, demonstrating broad applicability and effectiveness. Further experimental results show that our solutions outperform state-of-the-art methods in multi-domain recommendation scenarios and highlight their potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> |  |

This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems.

One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach. We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion. With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>peer ...</summary><p>peer reviewed publication at NLP4KGc @ Semantics 2024, see https://sites.google.com/view/3rdnlp4kgc</p></details> |

However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.

However, this paradigm relies on the use of a large number of labelled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases present significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with the pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI classification (FSWC) tasks. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC tasks. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multi-scale, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to get the WSI-level features. Based on two VLMs, extensive experiments and visualizations on three datasets demonstrated the powerful performance of our MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5tables</p></details> |

However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previously submitted to CCS on 04/29</p></details> |

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose \textbf{One for All (OFA)}, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

While established techniques enable handling multi-modal information, the challenges are posed when extended to various clinical modalities and practical modalitymissing setting due to the inherent modality gaps. To tackle these, we propose an innovative Modality-prompted Heterogeneous Graph for Omnimodal Learning (GTP-4o), which embeds the numerous disparate clinical modalities into a unified representation, completes the deficient embedding of missing modality and reformulates the cross-modal learning with a graph-based aggregation. Specially, we establish a heterogeneous graph embedding to explicitly capture the diverse semantic properties on both the modality-specific features (nodes) and the cross-modal relations (edges). Then, we design a modality-prompted completion that enables completing the inadequate graph representation of missing modality through a graph prompting mechanism, which generates hallucination graphic topologies to steer the missing embedding towards the intact representation. Through the completed graph, we meticulously develop a knowledge-guided hierarchical cross-modal aggregation consisting of a global meta-path neighbouring to uncover the potential heterogeneous neighbors along the pathways driven by domain knowledge, and a local multi-relation aggregation module for the comprehensive cross-modal interaction across various heterogeneous relations. We assess the efficacy of our methodology on rigorous benchmarking experiments against prior state-of-the-arts. In a nutshell, GTP-4o presents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of embedding, relating and perceiving the heterogeneous patterns from various clinical modalities holistically via a graph theory.

| **[MMGPL: Multimodal Medical Data Analysis with Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14574v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has demonstrated impressive efficacy in the fine-tuning of multimodal large models to a wide range of downstream tasks. Nonetheless, applying existing prompt learning methods for the diagnosis of neurological disorder still suffers from two issues: (i) existing methods typically treat all patches equally, despite the fact that only a small number of patches in neuroimaging are relevant to the disease, and (ii) they ignore the structural information inherent in the brain connection network which is crucial for understanding and diagnosing neurological disorders. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel prompt learning model by learning graph prompts during the fine-tuning process of multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Specifically, we first leverage GPT-4 to obtain relevant disease concepts and compute semantic similarity between these concepts and all patches. Secondly, we reduce the weight of irrelevant patches according to the semantic similarity between each patch and disease-related concepts. Moreover, we construct a graph among tokens based on these concepts and employ a graph convolutional network layer to extract the structural information of the graph, which is used to prompt the pre-trained multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance for neurological disorder diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods and validated by clinicians.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProG: A Graph Prompt Learning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05346v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial general intelligence on graphs has shown significant advancements across various applications, yet the traditional 'Pre-train & Fine-tune' paradigm faces inefficiencies and negative transfer issues, particularly in complex and few-shot settings. Graph prompt learning emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging lightweight prompts to manipulate data and fill the task gap by reformulating downstream tasks to the pretext. However, several critical challenges still remain: how to unify diverse graph prompt models, how to evaluate the quality of graph prompts, and to improve their usability for practical comparisons and selection. In response to these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for graph prompt learning. Our benchmark integrates SIX pre-training methods and FIVE state-of-the-art graph prompt techniques, evaluated across FIFTEEN diverse datasets to assess performance, flexibility, and efficiency. We also present 'ProG', an easy-to-use open-source library that streamlines the execution of various graph prompt models, facilitating objective evaluations. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that categorizes existing graph prompt methods into two main approaches: prompts as graphs and prompts as tokens. This framework enhances the applicability and comparison of graph prompt techniques. The code is available at: https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Graph Selective Prompt Learning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10498v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompt learning/tuning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained models for graph representation learning. As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority.

While GPL offers superior effectiveness in graph knowledge transfer and computational efficiency, the security risks posed by backdoor poisoning effects embedded in pretrained models remain largely unexplored. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of GPL's vulnerability to backdoor attacks. We introduce \textit{CrossBA}, the first cross-context backdoor attack against GPL, which manipulates only the pretraining phase without requiring knowledge of downstream applications. Our investigation reveals both theoretically and empirically that tuning trigger graphs, combined with prompt transformations, can seamlessly transfer the backdoor threat from pretrained encoders to downstream applications. Through extensive experiments involving 3 representative GPL methods across 5 distinct cross-context scenarios and 5 benchmark datasets of node and graph classification tasks, we demonstrate that \textit{CrossBA} consistently achieves high attack success rates while preserving the functionality of downstream applications over clean input. We also explore potential countermeasures against \textit{CrossBA} and conclude that current defenses are insufficient to mitigate \textit{CrossBA}. Our study highlights the persistent backdoor threats to GPL systems, raising trustworthiness concerns in the practices of GPL techniques.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Tuning Large Language Models for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18271v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[CuriousLLM: Elevating Multi-Document QA with Reasoning-Infused Knowledge Graph Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09077v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Question Answering (QA), unifying large language models (LLMs) with external databases has shown great success. However, these methods often fall short in providing the advanced reasoning needed for complex QA tasks. To address these issues, we improve over a novel approach called Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP), which combines knowledge graphs with a LLM-based agent to improve reasoning and search accuracy. Nevertheless, the original KGP framework necessitates costly fine-tuning with large datasets yet still suffers from LLM hallucination. Therefore, we propose a reasoning-infused LLM agent to enhance this framework. This agent mimics human curiosity to ask follow-up questions to more efficiently navigate the search. This simple modification significantly boosts the LLM performance in QA tasks without the high costs and latency associated with the initial KGP framework. Our ultimate goal is to further develop this approach, leading to more accurate, faster, and cost-effective solutions in the QA domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15240v5)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has sparked a research surge in adapting pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies, posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for downstream adaptations.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate representation learning on TIGs, researchers have proposed a series of TIG models. However, these models are still facing two tough gaps between the pre-training and downstream predictions in their ``pre-train, predict'' training paradigm. First, the temporal discrepancy between the pre-training and inference data severely undermines the models' applicability in distant future predictions on the dynamically evolving data. Second, the semantic divergence between pretext and downstream tasks hinders their practical applications, as they struggle to align with their learning and prediction capabilities across application scenarios. Recently, the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm has emerged as a lightweight mechanism for model generalization. Applying this paradigm is a potential solution to solve the aforementioned challenges. However, the adaptation of this paradigm to TIGs is not straightforward. The application of prompting in static graph contexts falls short in temporal settings due to a lack of consideration for time-sensitive dynamics and a deficiency in expressive power. To address this issue, we introduce Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting (TIGPrompt), a versatile framework that seamlessly integrates with TIG models, bridging both the temporal and semantic gaps. In detail, we propose a temporal prompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. These prompts stand out for their minimalistic design, relying solely on the tuning of the prompt generator with very little supervision data. To cater to varying computational resource demands, we propose an extended ``pre-train, prompt-based fine-tune'' paradigm, offering greater flexibility. Through extensive experiments, the TIGPrompt demonstrates the SOTA performance and remarkable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, due to the immense gap of data and tasks between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, the model performance is still limited. Inspired by prompt fine-tuning in Natural Language Processing(NLP), many endeavors have been made to bridge the gap in graph domain. But existing methods simply reformulate the form of fine-tuning tasks to the pre-training ones. With the premise that the pre-training graphs are compatible with the fine-tuning ones, these methods typically operate in transductive setting. In order to generalize graph pre-training to inductive scenario where the fine-tuning graphs might significantly differ from pre-training ones, we propose a novel graph prompt based method called Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt(IGAP). Firstly, we unify the mainstream graph pre-training frameworks and analyze the essence of graph pre-training from graph spectral theory. Then we identify the two sources of the data gap in inductive setting: (i) graph signal gap and (ii) graph structure gap. Based on the insight of graph pre-training, we propose to bridge the graph signal gap and the graph structure gap with learnable prompts in the spectral space. A theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of our method. At last, we conduct extensive experiments among nodes classification and graph classification tasks under the transductive, semi-inductive and inductive settings. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully bridge the data gap under different settings.</p></details> |  |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WWW 2024 as research paper</p></details> |

However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.</p></details> |  |

However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks.

This paper presents a pioneering survey on the emerging domain of graph prompts in AGI, addressing key challenges and opportunities in harnessing graph data for AGI applications. Despite substantial advancements in AGI across natural language processing and computer vision, the application to graph data is relatively underexplored.

| **[Contrastive Graph Prompt-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10685v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are frequently challenged by the data sparsity problem. One approach to mitigate this issue is through cross-domain recommendation techniques. In a cross-domain context, sharing knowledge between domains can enhance the effectiveness in the target domain. Recent cross-domain methods have employed a pre-training approach, but we argue that these methods often result in suboptimal fine-tuning, especially with large neural models. Modern language models utilize prompts for efficient model tuning. Such prompts act as a tunable latent vector, allowing for the freezing of the main model parameters. In our research, we introduce the Personalised Graph Prompt-based Recommendation (PGPRec) framework. This leverages the advantages of prompt-tuning. Within this framework, we formulate personalized graph prompts item-wise, rooted in items that a user has previously engaged with. Specifically, we employ Contrastive Learning (CL) to produce pre-trained embeddings that offer greater generalizability in the pre-training phase, ensuring robust training during the tuning phase. Our evaluation of PGPRec in cross-domain scenarios involves comprehensive testing with the top-k recommendation tasks and a cold-start analysis. Our empirical findings, based on four Amazon Review datasets, reveal that the PGPRec framework can decrease the tuned parameters by as much as 74%, maintaining competitive performance.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While many GNN-based solutions have emerged, the supervised paradigm depends on a large quantity of labeled data. A popular alternative is to adopt self-supervised pre-training using label-free data, and further fine-tune on a downstream task with limited labels. Nevertheless, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is often plagued by the objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. Hence, we propose VPGNN, a prompt-based fine-tuning framework on GNNs for voucher abuse detection. We design a novel graph prompting function to reformulate the downstream task into a similar template as the pretext task in pre-training, thereby narrowing the objective gap. Extensive experiments on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate the strength of VPGNN in both few-shot and semi-supervised scenarios. Moreover, an online deployment of VPGNN in a production environment shows a 23.4% improvement over two existing deployed models.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted by CIKM23 Applied Research Track</p></details> |

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model. It is worth mentioning that this paper is a technical report of our pre-release version, and we will report our specific experimental data in future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGL-PT: A Strong Graph Learner with Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12449v2)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, much exertion has been paid to design graph self-supervised methods to obtain generalized pre-trained models, and adapt pre-trained models onto downstream tasks through fine-tuning. However, there exists an inherent gap between pretext and downstream graph tasks, which insufficiently exerts the ability of pre-trained models and even leads to negative transfer. Meanwhile, prompt tuning has seen emerging success in natural language processing by aligning pre-training and fine-tuning with consistent training objectives. In this paper, we identify the challenges for graph prompt tuning: The first is the lack of a strong and universal pre-training task across sundry pre-training methods in graph domain. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of designing a consistent training objective for both pre-training and downstream tasks. To overcome above obstacles, we propose a novel framework named SGL-PT which follows the learning strategy ``Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict''. Specifically, we raise a strong and universal pre-training task coined as SGL that acquires the complementary merits of generative and contrastive self-supervised graph learning. And aiming for graph classification task, we unify pre-training and fine-tuning by designing a novel verbalizer-free prompting function, which reformulates the downstream task in a similar format as pretext task. Empirical results show that our method surpasses other baselines under unsupervised setting, and our prompt tuning method can greatly facilitate models on biological datasets over fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves using a pre-trained model and a prompting function that applies a template to input samples, adding indicative context and reformulating target tasks as the pre-training task. However, the design of prompts could be a challenging and time-consuming process in complex tasks. The limitation can be addressed by using graph data, as graphs serve as structured knowledge repositories by explicitly modeling the interaction between entities. In this survey, we review prompting methods from the graph perspective, where prompting functions are augmented with graph knowledge. In particular, we introduce the basic concepts of graph prompt learning, organize the existing work of designing graph prompting functions, and describe their applications and future challenges. This survey will bridge the gap between graphs and prompt design to facilitate future methodology development.</p></details> | 9 pages + 1 figure |

However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other. Experimental results across six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that ComGRL achieves excellent performance in node classification tasks. The code could be available at https://github.com/JinluWang1002/ComGRL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations. Theoretical analysis verifies the trustworthiness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art empirical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fusion Self-supervised Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely deployed in various web environments, and self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in this field. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation ($e.g.,$ discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Fusion Self-supervised Learning framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Short Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09219v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short text classification has gained significant attention in the information age due to its prevalence and real-world applications. Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

In this chapter, we have developed a joint multimodal scene graph for charts, explicitly representing the relationships between chart elements and their associated patterns. Our proposed multimodal scene graph consists of two components: a visual graph and a textual graph, each designed to capture the structural and semantic information within the chart. To unify representations across these different modalities, we introduce a multimodal graph contrastive learning approach that learns unified representations by maximizing similarity between nodes representing the same object across multimodal graphs. The learned graph representations can be seamlessly incorporated into a transformer decoder as a soft prompt. Additionally, given the growing need for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in zero-shot scenarios, we have designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts for MLLMs to reduce hallucinations. We tested both methods on public benchmarks such as ChartQA, OpenCQA, and ChartX, demonstrating improved performance and validating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

Effective link prediction on these graphs can uncover valuable connections, such as potential novel drug-disease relations. We introduce a novel multimodal approach that unifies embeddings from specialized Language Models (LMs) with Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to enhance intra-entity relationships while employing a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to capture inter-entity relationships for effective link prediction. To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes. Experimental results on PrimeKG++ and the DrugBank drug-target interaction dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse biomedical datasets.

| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks on Graph-level Tasks: Comprehensive Experiments, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03977v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

| **[CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14451v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2023 |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," where restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge and enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-GCL: An Event-Based Simple and Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Text Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11652v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 tables |

However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art GCL methods or even some supervised GNNs, AFECL achieves SOTA performance on link prediction and semi-supervised node classification of extremely scarce labels.

| **[Single-View Graph Contrastive Learning with Soft Neighborhood Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09261v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods heavily rely on cross-view contrast, thus facing several concomitant challenges, such as the complexity of designing effective augmentations, the potential for information loss between views, and increased computational costs. To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

| **[Uncovering Capabilities of Model Pruning in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20356v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has achieved great success in pre-training graph neural networks without ground-truth labels. Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection Using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the power of learning representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the community detection under the community structure semantics and propose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale networks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that minimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is worth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the perspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more accurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy, modularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.</p></details> |  |

However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning via Seamless Proximity Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15270v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aligns node representations by classifying node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented graphs. The conventional GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[A Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-shot Link Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10779v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot link prediction (ZSLP) on knowledge graphs aims at automatically identifying relations between given entities. Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

However, explicit graph augmentations may lead to a loss of semantics in the contrastive views. Secondly, existing methods tend to overlook edge features and the varying significance of node features during multi-graph learning. Moreover, the contrastive loss suffer from false negatives. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method of contrastive multi-graph learning with neighbor hierarchical sifting for semi-supervised text classification, namely ConNHS. Specifically, we exploit core features to form a multi-relational text graph, enhancing semantic connections among texts. By separating text graphs, we provide diverse views for contrastive learning. Our approach ensures optimal preservation of the graph information, minimizing data loss and distortion. Then, we separately execute relation-aware propagation and cross-graph attention propagation, which effectively leverages the varying correlations between nodes and edge features while harmonising the information fusion across graphs. Subsequently, we present the neighbor hierarchical sifting loss (NHS) to refine the negative selection. For one thing, following the homophily assumption, NHS masks first-order neighbors of the anchor and positives from being negatives. For another, NHS excludes the high-order neighbors analogous to the anchor based on their similarities. Consequently, it effectively reduces the occurrence of false negatives, preventing the expansion of the distance between similar samples in the embedding space. Our experiments on ThuCNews, SogouNews, 20 Newsgroups, and Ohsumed datasets achieved 95.86\%, 97.52\%, 87.43\%, and 70.65\%, which demonstrates competitive results in semi-supervised text classification.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Especially inductive GNNs, which allow for the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. As such these networks become attractive targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing model-stealing attacks that extract models trained on images and texts. However, little attention has been given to stealing GNNs trained on graph data. This paper identifies a new method of performing unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, utilizing graph contrastive learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the targeted model. The new type of attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets and the results show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art by Shen et al. (2021). In particular, our attack surpasses the baseline across all benchmarks, attaining superior fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while necessitating fewer queries directed toward the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI - 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to detect fake news on future events. Recently, numerous fake news detection models that utilize textual information and the propagation structure of posts have been proposed. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge since they rely heavily on event-specific features for prediction and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce \textbf{F}uture \textbf{AD}aptive \textbf{E}vent-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to obtain higher-quality features and make more accurate overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. We further mitigate event bias by subtracting the event-only predictor's output from the target predictor's output to obtain the final prediction. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of graph characteristics while controlling the distribution of generated subgraphs. We employ optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGEC outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |

However, the label information is not always effectively utilized in the traditional GCN framework. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (\ie ELU-graph), which enables GCNs to effectively utilize label information. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of 77.53% while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions series journal</p></details> |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The one of the effective ways to reduce the number of samples is using hard negatives (e.g., Mixup). Designing mixing-based approach for GAD can be difficult due to imbalanced data or limited number of anomalies. We propose ANOMIX, a framework that consists of a novel graph mixing approach, ANOMIX-M, and multi-level contrasts for GAD. ANOMIX-M can effectively mix abnormality and normality from input graph to generate hard negatives, which are important for efficient GCL. ANOMIX is (a) A first mixing approach: firstly attempting graph mixing to generate hard negatives for GAD task and node- and subgraph-level contrasts to distinguish underlying anomalies. (b) Accurate: winning the highest AUC, up to 5.49% higher and 1.76% faster. (c) Effective: reducing the number of samples nearly 80% in GCL.

As IoT devices proliferate and rapidly evolve, their highly heterogeneous hardware architectures and complex compilation settings, coupled with the demand for large-scale function retrieval in practical applications, put forward higher requirements for BCSD methods. In this paper, we propose IRBinDiff, which mitigates compilation differences by leveraging LLVM-IR with higher-level semantic abstraction, and integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph neural network to capture both semantic and structural information from different perspectives. By introducing momentum contrastive learning, it effectively enhances retrieval capabilities in large-scale candidate function sets, distinguishing between subtle function similarities and differences. Our extensive experiments, conducted under varied compilation settings, demonstrate that IRBinDiff outperforms other leading BCSD methods in both One-to-one comparison and One-to-many search scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

A recommender system is considered unfair when it produces unequal outcomes for different user groups based on user-sensitive attributes (e.g., age, gender). Some researchers have proposed data augmentation-based methods aiming at alleviating user-level unfairness by altering the skewed distribution of training data among various user groups. Despite yielding promising results, they often rely on fairness-related assumptions that may not align with reality, potentially reducing the data quality and negatively affecting model effectiveness. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study how to implement high-quality data augmentation to improve recommendation fairness. Specifically, we propose FairDgcl, a dynamic graph adversarial contrastive learning framework aiming at improving fairness in recommender system. First, FairDgcl develops an adversarial contrastive network with a view generator and a view discriminator to learn generating fair augmentation strategies in an adversarial style. Then, we propose two dynamic, learnable models to generate contrastive views within contrastive learning framework, which automatically fine-tune the augmentation strategies. Meanwhile, we theoretically show that FairDgcl can simultaneously generate enhanced representations that possess both fairness and accuracy. Lastly, comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FairDgcl.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to TKDE</p></details> |

The existing research on efficient data augmentation methods and ideal pretext tasks for graph contrastive learning remains limited, resulting in suboptimal node representation in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we introduce LAC, a graph contrastive learning framework with learnable data augmentation in an orthogonal continuous space. To capture the representative information in the graph data during augmentation, we introduce a continuous view augmenter, that applies both a masked topology augmentation module and a cross-channel feature augmentation module to adaptively augment the topological information and the feature information within an orthogonal continuous space, respectively. The orthogonal nature of continuous space ensures that the augmentation process avoids dimension collapse. To enhance the effectiveness of pretext tasks, we propose an information-theoretic principle named InfoBal and introduce corresponding pretext tasks. These tasks enable the continuous view augmenter to maintain consistency in the representative information across views while maximizing diversity between views, and allow the encoder to fully utilize the representative information in the unsupervised setting. Our experimental results show that LAC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCL-based text classification methods often suffer from negative sampling bias, where similar nodes are incorrectly paired as negative pairs. This can lead to over-clustering, where instances of the same class are divided into different clusters. To address the over-clustering issue, we propose an innovative GCL-based method of graph contrastive learning via cluster-refined negative sampling for semi-supervised text classification, namely ClusterText. Firstly, we combine the pre-trained model Bert with graph neural networks to learn text representations. Secondly, we introduce a clustering refinement strategy, which clusters the learned text representations to obtain pseudo labels. For each text node, its negative sample set is drawn from different clusters. Additionally, we propose a self-correction mechanism to mitigate the loss of true negative samples caused by clustering inconsistency. By calculating the Euclidean distance between each text node and other nodes within the same cluster, distant nodes are still selected as negative samples. Our proposed ClusterText demonstrates good scalable computing, as it can effectively extract important information from from a large amount of data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ClusterText in text classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Our study finds that the difference in high-frequency information between augmented graphs is greater than that in low-frequency information. However, most existing GCL methods focus mainly on the time domain (low-frequency information) for node feature representations and cannot make good use of high-frequency information to speed up model convergence. Furthermore, existing GCL paradigms optimize graph embedding representations by pulling the distance between positive sample pairs closer and pushing the distance between positive and negative sample pairs farther away, but our theoretical analysis shows that graph contrastive learning benefits from pushing negative pairs farther away rather than pulling positive pairs closer. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel spectral GCL framework without positive samples, named SpeGCL. Specifically, to solve the problem that existing GCL methods cannot utilize high-frequency information, SpeGCL uses a Fourier transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency information of node features, and constructs a contrastive learning mechanism in a Fourier space to obtain better node feature representation. Furthermore, SpeGCL relies entirely on negative samples to refine the graph embedding. We also provide a theoretical justification for the efficacy of using only negative samples in SpeGCL. Extensive experiments on un-supervised learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning have validated the superiority of our SpeGCL framework over the state-of-the-art GCL methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

These changes lead to temporal degradation in entity linking models, characterized as a decline in model performance over time. To address this issue, we propose leveraging graph relationships to aggregate information from neighboring entities across different time periods. This approach enhances the ability to distinguish similar entities over time, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal degradation. We introduce \textbf{CYCLE}: \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{Y}ear \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{E}ntity-Linking. This model employs a novel graph contrastive learning method to tackle temporal performance degradation in entity linking tasks. Our contrastive learning method treats newly added graph relationships as \textit{positive} samples and newly removed ones as \textit{negative} samples. This approach helps our model effectively prevent temporal degradation, achieving a 13.90\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art from 2023 when the time gap is one year, and a 17.79\% improvement as the gap expands to three years. Further analysis shows that CYCLE is particularly robust for low-degree entities, which are less resistant to temporal degradation due to their sparse connectivity, making them particularly suitable for our method.

| **[Towards Cross-domain Few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08629v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot graph anomaly detection (GAD) has recently garnered increasing attention, which aims to discern anomalous patterns among abundant unlabeled test nodes under the guidance of a limited number of labeled training nodes. Existing few-shot GAD approaches typically adopt meta-training methods trained on richly labeled auxiliary networks to facilitate rapid adaptation to target networks that possess sparse labels. However, these proposed methods often assume that the auxiliary and target networks exist in the same data distributions-an assumption rarely holds in practical settings. This paper explores a more prevalent and complex scenario of cross-domain few-shot GAD, where the goal is to identify anomalies within sparsely labeled target graphs using auxiliary graphs from a related, yet distinct domain. The challenge here is nontrivial owing to inherent data distribution discrepancies between the source and target domains, compounded by the uncertainties of sparse labeling in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework, termed CDFS-GAD, specifically designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. CDFS-GAD first introduces a domain-adaptive graph contrastive learning module, which is aimed at enhancing cross-domain feature alignment. Then, a prompt tuning module is further designed to extract domain-specific features tailored to each domain. Moreover, a domain-adaptive hypersphere classification loss is proposed to enhance the discrimination between normal and anomalous instances under minimal supervision, utilizing domain-sensitive norms. Lastly, a self-training strategy is introduced to further refine the predicted scores, enhancing its reliability in few-shot settings.

| **[TwinCL: A Twin Graph Contrastive Learning Model for Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19169v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of recommendation and collaborative filtering, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has become an influential approach. Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of contrastive learning are still not well understood. In this paper, we challenge the conventional use of random augmentations on graph structure or embedding space in GCL, which may disrupt the structural and semantic information inherent in Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, fixed-rate data augmentation proves to be less effective compared to augmentation with an adaptive rate. In the initial training phases, significant perturbations are more suitable, while as the training approaches convergence, milder perturbations yield better results. We introduce a twin encoder in place of random augmentations, demonstrating the redundancy of traditional augmentation techniques. The twin encoder updating mechanism ensures the generation of more diverse contrastive views in the early stages, transitioning to views with greater similarity as training progresses. In addition, we investigate the learned representations from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on a hypersphere to optimize more efficiently. Our proposed Twin Graph Contrastive Learning model -- TwinCL -- aligns positive pairs of user and item embeddings and the representations from the twin encoder while maintaining the uniformity of the embeddings on the hypersphere. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model optimizing alignment and uniformity with the twin encoder contributes to better recommendation accuracy and training efficiency performance. In comprehensive experiments on three public datasets, our proposed TwinCL achieves an average improvement of 5.6% (NDCG@10) in recommendation accuracy with faster training speed, while effectively mitigating popularity bias.</p></details> |  |

However, existing data mining approaches generally either completely ignore or simply treat emojis as ordinary Unicode characters, which may limit the model's ability to grasp the rich semantic information in emojis and the interaction between emojis and texts. Thus, it is necessary to release the emoji's power in social media data mining. To this end, we first construct a heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes, i.e. post, word and emoji nodes to improve the representation of different elements in posts. The edges are also well-defined to model how these three elements interact with each other. To facilitate the sharing of information among post, word and emoji nodes, we propose a graph pre-train framework for text and emoji co-modeling, which contains two graph pre-training tasks: node-level graph contrastive learning and edge-level link reconstruction learning. Extensive experiments on the Xiaohongshu and Twitter datasets with two types of downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach proves significant improvement over previous strong baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Multiplex Graph Contrastive Learning with Soft Negatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08010v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) seeks to learn nodal or graph representations that contain maximal consistent information from graph-structured data. While node-level contrasting modes are dominating, some efforts commence to explore consistency across different scales. Yet, they tend to lose consistent information and be contaminated by disturbing features. Here, we introduce MUX-GCL, a novel cross-scale contrastive learning paradigm that utilizes multiplex representations as effective patches. While this learning mode minimizes contaminating noises, a commensurate contrasting strategy using positional affinities further avoids information loss by correcting false negative pairs across scales. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate that MUX-GCL yields multiple state-of-the-art results on public datasets. Our theoretical analysis further guarantees the new objective function as a stricter lower bound of mutual information of raw input features and output embeddings, which rationalizes this paradigm.

| **[GRE^2-MDCL: Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07725v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for preserving graph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various downstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised node clustering via contrastive hard sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07718v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a fine-grained contrastive learning scheme for unsupervised node clustering. Previous clustering methods only focus on a small feature set (class-dependent features), which demonstrates explicit clustering characteristics, ignoring the rest of the feature spaces (class-invariant features). This paper exploits class-invariant features via graph contrastive learning to discover additional high-quality features for unsupervised clustering. We formulate a novel node-level fine-grained augmentation framework for self-supervised learning, which iteratively identifies competitive contrastive samples from the whole feature spaces, in the form of positive and negative examples of node relations. While positive examples of node relations are usually expressed as edges in graph homophily, negative examples are implicit without a direct edge. We show, however, that simply sampling nodes beyond the local neighborhood results in less competitive negative pairs, that are less effective for contrastive learning. Inspired by counterfactual augmentation, we instead sample competitive negative node relations by creating virtual nodes that inherit (in a self-supervised fashion) class-invariant features, while altering class-dependent features, creating contrasting pairs that lie closer to the boundary and offering better contrast. Consequently, our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in supervised node clustering tasks on six baselines and six real-world social network datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMP: Learnable Meta-Path Guided Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06323v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have significantly propelled the information retrieval (IR) field. Still, the effectiveness of HGNNs heavily relies on high-quality labels, which are often expensive to acquire. This challenge has shifted attention towards Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which usually requires pre-defined meta-paths. However, our findings reveal that meta-path combinations significantly affect performance in unsupervised settings, an aspect often overlooked in current literature. Existing HGCL methods have considerable variability in outcomes across different meta-path combinations, thereby challenging the optimization process to achieve consistent and high performance. In response, we introduce \textsf{LAMP} (\underline{\textbf{L}}earn\underline{\textbf{A}}ble \underline{\textbf{M}}eta-\underline{\textbf{P}}ath), a novel adversarial contrastive learning approach that integrates various meta-path sub-graphs into a unified and stable structure, leveraging the overlap among these sub-graphs. To address the denseness of this integrated sub-graph, we propose an adversarial training strategy for edge pruning, maintaining sparsity to enhance model performance and robustness. \textsf{LAMP} aims to maximize the difference between meta-path and network schema views for guiding contrastive learning to capture the most meaningful information. Our extensive experimental study conducted on four diverse datasets from the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) demonstrates that \textsf{LAMP} significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised models in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spectral-Aware Augmentation for Enhanced Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13845v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in learning representations on graphs in recent years. To generate ideal augmentation views, the augmentation generation methods should preserve essential information while discarding less relevant details for downstream tasks. However, current augmentation methods usually involve random topology corruption in the spatial domain, which fails to adequately address information spread across different frequencies in the spectral domain. Our preliminary study highlights this issue, demonstrating that spatial random perturbations impact all frequency bands almost uniformly. Given that task-relevant information typically resides in specific spectral regions that vary across graphs, this one-size-fits-all approach can pose challenges. We argue that indiscriminate spatial random perturbation might unintentionally weaken task-relevant information, reducing its effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, we propose applying perturbations selectively, focusing on information specific to different frequencies across diverse graphs. In this paper, we present GASSER, a model that applies tailored perturbations to specific frequencies of graph structures in the spectral domain, guided by spectral hints. Through extensive experimentation and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the augmentation views generated by GASSER are adaptive, controllable, and intuitively aligned with the homophily ratios and spectrum of graph structures.</p></details> |  |

However, GCL for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has yet to be explored. Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing. Such a strategy faces three key challenges: I) failure to avoid information loss, II) semantic loss during the text encoding phase, and III) implicit augmentation constraints that lead to uncontrollable and incomprehensible results. In this paper, we propose a novel GCL framework named LATEX-GCL to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce textual augmentations and LLMs' powerful natural language processing (NLP) abilities to address the three limitations aforementioned to pave the way for applying GCL to TAG tasks. Extensive experiments on four high-quality TAG datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed LATEX-GCL method. The source codes and datasets are released to ease the reproducibility, which can be accessed via this link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LATEX-GCL-0712.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Information Bottleneck for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02545v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

The MER task extracts and fuses complementary semantic information from different modalities, which can classify the speaker's emotions. However, the existing feature fusion methods have usually mapped the features of different modalities into the same feature space for information fusion, which can not eliminate the heterogeneity between different modalities. Therefore, it is challenging to make the subsequent emotion class boundary learning. To tackle the above problems, we have proposed a novel Adversarial Representation with Intra-Modal and Inter-Modal Graph Contrastive for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (AR-IIGCN) method. Firstly, we input video, audio, and text features into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map them into separate feature spaces. Secondly, we build a generator and a discriminator for the three modal features through adversarial representation, which can achieve information interaction between modalities and eliminate heterogeneity among modalities. Thirdly, we introduce contrastive graph representation learning to capture intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information and learn intra-class and inter-class boundary information of emotion categories. Specifically, we construct a graph structure for three modal features and perform contrastive representation learning on nodes with different emotions in the same modality and the same emotion in different modalities, which can improve the feature representation ability of nodes. Extensive experimental works show that the ARL-IIGCN method can significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Most existing GCL-based recommenders generate contrastive views by altering the graph structure or introducing perturbations to embedding. While these methods effectively enhance learning from sparse data, they risk performance degradation or even training collapse when the differences between contrastive views become too pronounced. To mitigate this issue, we employ curriculum learning to incrementally increase the disparity between contrastive views, enabling the model to gain from more challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a dual-adversarial graph learning approach, AvoGCL, which emulates curriculum learning by progressively applying adversarial training to graph structures and embedding perturbations. Specifically, AvoGCL construct contrastive views by reducing graph redundancy and generating adversarial perturbations in the embedding space, and achieve better results by gradually increasing the difficulty of contrastive views. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AvoGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model. In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment (ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect from noisy target pseudo labels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in the blended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.</p></details> |  |

Integration of CL with graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative filterings (CFs) has been explored in recommender systems. However, current CL-based recommendation models heavily rely on low-pass filters and graph augmentations. In this paper, inspired by the reaction-diffusion equation, we propose a novel CL method for recommender systems called the reaction-diffusion graph contrastive learning model (RDGCL). We design our own GCN for CF based on the equations of diffusion, i.e., low-pass filter, and reaction, i.e., high-pass filter. Our proposed CL-based training occurs between reaction and diffusion-based embeddings, so there is no need for graph augmentations. Experimental evaluation on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CL-based recommendation models. By enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversity, our method brings an advancement in CL for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Jeong...</summary><p>Jeongwhan Choi and Hyowon Wi are co-first authors with equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Task Curriculum Graph Contrastive Learning with Clustering Entropy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12071v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unsupervised deep graph clustering have been significantly promoted by contrastive learning. Despite the strides, most graph contrastive learning models face challenges: 1) graph augmentation is used to improve learning diversity, but commonly used random augmentation methods may destroy inherent semantics and cause noise; 2) the fixed positive and negative sample selection strategy is limited to deal with complex real data, thereby impeding the model's capability to capture fine-grained patterns and relationships. To reduce these problems, we propose the Clustering-guided Curriculum Graph contrastive Learning (CCGL) framework. CCGL uses clustering entropy as the guidance of the following graph augmentation and contrastive learning. Specifically, according to the clustering entropy, the intra-class edges and important features are emphasized in augmentation. Then, a multi-task curriculum learning scheme is proposed, which employs the clustering guidance to shift the focus from the discrimination task to the clustering task. In this way, the sample selection strategy of contrastive learning can be adjusted adaptively from early to late stage, which enhances the model's flexibility for complex data structure. Experimental results demonstrate that CCGL has achieved excellent performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Latent Factor Analysis Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04838v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful learning methods for recommender systems owing to their robustness in handling complicated user-item interactions. Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue of highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e., nodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to construct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only brings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals effectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA) enhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to implement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an augmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise signals. Experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed LFA-GCL outperforms the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing augmentation methods, such as directly perturbing interaction graph (e.g., node/edge dropout), may interfere with the original connections and generate poor contrasting views, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we define the views that share only a small amount of information with the original graph due to poor data augmentation as noisy views (i.e., the last 20% of the views with a cosine similarity value less than 0.1 to the original view). We demonstrate through detailed experiments that noisy views will significantly degrade recommendation performance. Further, we propose a model-agnostic Symmetric Graph Contrastive Learning (SGCL) method with theoretical guarantees to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce symmetry theory into graph contrastive learning, based on which we propose a symmetric form and contrast loss resistant to noisy interference. We provide theoretical proof that our proposed SGCL method has a high tolerance to noisy views. Further demonstration is given by conducting extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases recommendation accuracy, with relative improvements reaching as high as 12.25% over nine other competing models. These results highlight the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, submitted to TOIS</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of labeled data remains a major challenge in this field, limiting the widespread use of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, a semi-supervised Dual-stream Self-Attentive Adversarial Graph Contrastive learning framework (termed as DS-AGC) is proposed to tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. The DS-AGC framework includes two parallel streams for extracting non-structural and structural EEG features. The non-structural stream incorporates a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation method to alleviate distribution discrepancy among labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and unknown target domain. The structural stream develops a graph contrastive learning method to extract effective graph-based feature representation from multiple EEG channels in a semi-supervised manner. Further, a self-attentive fusion module is developed for feature fusion, sample selection, and emotion recognition, which highlights EEG features more relevant to emotions and data samples in the labeled source domain that are closer to the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) using a semi-supervised cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation scheme show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods under different incomplete label conditions (with an average improvement of 5.83% on SEED and 6.99% on SEED-IV), demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the label scarcity problem in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.06496</p></details> |

Despite the success of GNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a small number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always contain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node representations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be effective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most existing GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to create multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information (MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature representation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple contrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information irrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an effective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which can adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the optimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in multiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible about node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original views and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to improve the robustness of node feature representation. Extensive experiments on real-world public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Recent graph learning-driven models have made remarkable progress in the field of recommendation, but their performance in the academic reviewer recommendation task may suffer from a significant false negative issue. This arises from the assumption that unobserved edges represent negative samples. In fact, the mechanism of anonymous review results in inadequate exposure of interactions between reviewers and submissions, leading to a higher number of unobserved interactions compared to those caused by reviewers declining to participate. Therefore, investigating how to better comprehend the negative labeling of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations is a significant challenge. This study aims to tackle the ambiguous nature of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Pseudo Neg-Label strategy to enhance graph contrastive learning (GCL) for recommending reviewers for academic submissions, which we call RevGNN. RevGNN utilizes a two-stage encoder structure that encodes both scientific knowledge and behavior using Pseudo Neg-Label to approximate review preference. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RevGNN outperforms all baselines across four metrics. Additionally, detailed further analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component in RevGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (e.g., brand preferences or demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |
| **[Your Graph Recommender is Provably a Single-view Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17723v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph recommender (GR) is a type of graph neural network (GNNs) encoder that is customized for extracting information from the user-item interaction graph. Due to its strong performance on the recommendation task, GR has gained significant attention recently. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is also a popular research direction that aims to learn, often unsupervised, GNNs with certain contrastive objectives. As a general graph representation learning method, GCLs have been widely adopted with the supervised recommendation loss for joint training of GRs. Despite the intersection of GR and GCL research, theoretical understanding of the relationship between the two fields is surprisingly sparse. This vacancy inevitably leads to inefficient scientific research. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the field of GR and GCL from the perspective of encoders and loss functions. With mild assumptions, we theoretically show an astonishing fact that graph recommender is equivalent to a commonly-used single-view graph contrastive model. Specifically, we find that (1) the classic encoder in GR is essentially a linear graph convolutional network with one-hot inputs, and (2) the loss function in GR is well bounded by a single-view GCL loss with certain hyperparameters. The first observation enables us to explain crucial designs of GR models, e.g., the removal of self-loop and nonlinearity. And the second finding can easily prompt many cross-field research directions. We empirically show a remarkable result that the recommendation loss and the GCL loss can be used interchangeably. The fact that we can train GR models solely with the GCL loss is particularly insightful, since before this work, GCLs were typically viewed as unsupervised methods that need fine-tuning. We also discuss some potential future works inspired by our theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Reorganized Graph Contrastive Learning with Mitigating Semantic Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16726v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is an effective paradigm for node representation learning in graphs. The key components hidden behind GCL are data augmentation and positive-negative pair selection. Typical data augmentations in GCL, such as uniform deletion of edges, are generally blind and resort to local perturbation, which is prone to producing under-diversity views. Additionally, there is a risk of making the augmented data traverse to other classes. Moreover, most methods always treat all other samples as negatives. Such a negative pairing naturally results in sampling bias and likewise may make the learned representation suffer from semantic drift. Therefore, to increase the diversity of the contrastive view, we propose two simple and effective global topological augmentations to compensate current GCL. One is to mine the semantic correlation between nodes in the feature space. The other is to utilize the algebraic properties of the adjacency matrix to characterize the topology by eigen-decomposition. With the help of both, we can retain important edges to build a better view. To reduce the risk of semantic drift, a prototype-based negative pair selection is further designed which can filter false negative samples.

However, most existing GCL models rely on heuristic approaches and usually assume entity independence when constructing contrastive views. We argue that these methods struggle to strike a balance between semantic invariance and view hardness across the dynamic training process, both of which are critical factors in graph contrastive learning. To address the above issues, we propose a novel GCL-based recommendation framework RGCL, which effectively maintains the semantic invariance of contrastive pairs and dynamically adapts as the model capability evolves through the training process. Specifically, RGCL first introduces decision boundary-aware adversarial perturbations to constrain the exploration space of contrastive augmented views, avoiding the decrease of task-specific information. Furthermore, to incorporate global user-user and item-item collaboration relationships for guiding on the generation of hard contrastive views, we propose an adversarial-contrastive learning objective to construct a relation-aware view-generator. Besides, considering that unsupervised GCL could potentially narrower margins between data points and the decision boundary, resulting in decreased model robustness, we introduce the adversarial examples based on maximum perturbations to achieve margin maximization. We also provide theoretical analyses on the effectiveness of our designs. Through extensive experiments on five public datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RGCL compared against twelve baseline models.</p></details> | KDD 2024 |
| **[L^2CL: Embarrassingly Simple Layer-to-Layer Contrastive Learning for Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14266v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as an effective approach to model neighborhood signals in collaborative filtering. Towards this research line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) demonstrates robust capabilities to address the supervision label shortage issue through generating massive self-supervised signals. Despite its effectiveness, GCL for recommendation suffers seriously from two main challenges: i) GCL relies on graph augmentation to generate semantically different views for contrasting, which could potentially disrupt key information and introduce unwanted noise; ii) current works for GCL primarily focus on contrasting representations using sophisticated networks architecture (usually deep) to capture high-order interactions, which leads to increased computational complexity and suboptimal training efficiency. To this end, we propose L2CL, a principled Layer-to-Layer Contrastive Learning framework that contrasts representations from different layers. By aligning the semantic similarities between different layers, L2CL enables the learning of complex structural relationships and gets rid of the noise perturbation in stochastic data augmentation. Surprisingly, we find that L2CL, using only one-hop contrastive learning paradigm, is able to capture intrinsic semantic structures and improve the quality of node representation, leading to a simple yet effective architecture. We also provide theoretical guarantees for L2CL in minimizing task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods.

| **[Consistency and Discrepancy-Based Contrastive Tripartite Graph Learning for Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05126v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tripartite graph-based recommender systems markedly diverge from traditional models by recommending unique combinations such as user groups and item bundles. Despite their effectiveness, these systems exacerbate the longstanding cold-start problem in traditional recommender systems, because any number of user groups or item bundles can be formed among users or items. To address this issue, we introduce a Consistency and Discrepancy-based graph contrastive learning method for tripartite graph-based Recommendation. This approach leverages two novel meta-path-based metrics consistency and discrepancy to capture nuanced, implicit associations between the recommended objects and the recommendees. These metrics, indicative of high-order similarities, can be efficiently calculated with infinite graph convolutional networks layers under a multi-objective optimization framework, using the limit theory of GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Spectral Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00708v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs can well describe the complex entity relationships in the real world. For example, online shopping networks contain multiple physical types of consumers and products, as well as multiple relationship types such as purchasing and favoriting. More and more scholars pay attention to this research because heterogeneous graph representation learning shows strong application potential in real-world scenarios. However, the existing heterogeneous graph models use data augmentation techniques to enhance the use of graph structure information, which only captures the graph structure information from the spatial topology, ignoring the information displayed in the spectrum dimension of the graph structure. To address the issue that heterogeneous graph representation learning methods fail to model spectral information, this paper introduces a spectral-enhanced graph contrastive learning model (SHCL) and proposes a spectral augmentation algorithm for the first time in heterogeneous graph neural networks. The proposed model learns an adaptive topology augmentation scheme through the heterogeneous graph itself, disrupting the structural information of the heterogeneous graph in the spectrum dimension, and ultimately improving the learning effect of the model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate substantial advantages of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoGCL: Topological Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17251v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a new concept which allows for capitalizing on the strengths of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn rich representations in a wide variety of applications which involve abundant unlabeled information. However, existing GCL approaches largely tend to overlook the important latent information on higher-order graph substructures. We address this limitation by introducing the concepts of topological invariance and extended persistence on graphs to GCL. In particular, we propose a new contrastive mode which targets topological representations of the two augmented views from the same graph, yielded by extracting latent shape properties of the graph at multiple resolutions. Along with the extended topological layer, we introduce a new extended persistence summary, namely, extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and derive its theoretical stability guarantees. Our extensive numerical results on biological, chemical, and social interaction graphs show that the new Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL) model delivers significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification for 11 out of 12 considered datasets and also exhibits robustness under noisy scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Overfitting to Robustness: Quantity, Quality, and Variety Oriented Negative Sample Selection in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15044v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to contrast positive-negative counterparts to learn the node embeddings, whereas graph data augmentation methods are employed to generate these positive-negative samples. The variation, quantity, and quality of negative samples compared to positive samples play crucial roles in learning meaningful embeddings for node classification downstream tasks. Less variation, excessive quantity, and low-quality negative samples cause the model to be overfitted for particular nodes, resulting in less robust models. To solve the overfitting problem in the GCL paradigm, this study proposes a novel Cumulative Sample Selection (CSS) algorithm by comprehensively considering negative samples' quality, variations, and quantity. Initially, three negative sample pools are constructed: easy, medium, and hard negative samples, which contain 25%, 50%, and 25% of the total available negative samples, respectively. Then, 10% negative samples are selected from each of these three negative sample pools for training the model. After that, a decision agent module evaluates model training results and decides whether to explore more negative samples from three negative sample pools by increasing the ratio or keep exploiting the current sampling ratio. The proposed algorithm is integrated into a proposed graph contrastive learning framework named NegAmplify. NegAmplify is compared with the SOTA methods on nine graph node classification datasets, with seven achieving better node classification accuracy with up to 2.86% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Modularity Maximization for Graph Clustering: A Contrastive Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14288v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering, a fundamental and challenging task in graph mining, aims to classify nodes in a graph into several disjoint clusters. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a dominant line of research in graph clustering and advances the new state-of-the-art. However, GCL-based methods heavily rely on graph augmentations and contrastive schemes, which may potentially introduce challenges such as semantic drift and scalability issues. Another promising line of research involves the adoption of modularity maximization, a popular and effective measure for community detection, as the guiding principle for clustering tasks. Despite the recent progress, the underlying mechanism of modularity maximization is still not well understood. In this work, we dig into the hidden success of modularity maximization for graph clustering. Our analysis reveals the strong connections between modularity maximization and graph contrastive learning, where positive and negative examples are naturally defined by modularity. In light of our results, we propose a community-aware graph clustering framework, coined MAGI, which leverages modularity maximization as a contrastive pretext task to effectively uncover the underlying information of communities in graphs, while avoiding the problem of semantic drift. Extensive experiments on multiple graph datasets verify the effectiveness of MAGI in terms of scalability and clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art graph clustering methods. Notably, MAGI easily scales a sufficiently large graph with 100M nodes while outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2024 research track.

However, the cost for collecting ST data is much higher than acquiring histopathological images, and thus several studies attempt to predict the gene expression on ST by leveraging their corresponding histopathological images. Most of the existing image-based gene prediction models treat the prediction task on each spot of ST data independently, which ignores the spatial dependency among spots. In addition, while the histology images share phenotypic characteristics with the ST data, it is still challenge to extract such common information to help align paired image and expression representations. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning framework with HSIC-bottleneck Regularization(ST-GCHB) aiming at learning shared representation to help impute the gene expression of the queried imagingspots by considering their spatial dependency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAugLLM: Improving Graph Contrastive Learning for Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11945v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies self-supervised graph learning for text-attributed graphs (TAGs) where nodes are represented by textual attributes. Unlike traditional graph contrastive methods that perturb the numerical feature space and alter the graph's topological structure, we aim to improve view generation through language supervision. This is driven by the prevalence of textual attributes in real applications, which complement graph structures with rich semantic information. However, this presents challenges because of two major reasons. First, text attributes often vary in length and quality, making it difficulty to perturb raw text descriptions without altering their original semantic meanings. Second, although text attributes complement graph structures, they are not inherently well-aligned. To bridge the gap, we introduce GAugLLM, a novel framework for augmenting TAGs. It leverages advanced large language models like Mistral to enhance self-supervised graph learning. Specifically, we introduce a mixture-of-prompt-expert technique to generate augmented node features. This approach adaptively maps multiple prompt experts, each of which modifies raw text attributes using prompt engineering, into numerical feature space. Additionally, we devise a collaborative edge modifier to leverage structural and textual commonalities, enhancing edge augmentation by examining or building connections between nodes. Empirical results across five benchmark datasets spanning various domains underscore our framework's ability to enhance the performance of leading contrastive methods as a plug-in tool. Notably, we observe that the augmented features and graph structure can also enhance the performance of standard generative methods, as well as popular graph neural networks. The open-sourced implementation of our GAugLLM is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

However, their generalization performance degrades when noisy labels are present in the training data. Most existing noisy labeling approaches focus on the visual domain or graph node classification tasks and analyze the impact of noisy labels only from a utility perspective. Unlike existing work, in this paper, we measure the effects of noise labels on graph classification from data privacy and model utility perspectives. We find that noise labels degrade the model's generalization performance and enhance the ability of membership inference attacks on graph data privacy. To this end, we propose the robust graph neural network approach with noisy labeled graph classification. Specifically, we first accurately filter the noisy samples by high-confidence samples and the first feature principal component vector of each class. Then, the robust principal component vectors and the model output under data augmentation are utilized to achieve noise label correction guided by dual spatial information. Finally, supervised graph contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the embedding quality of the model and protect the privacy of the training graph data. The utility and privacy of the proposed method are validated by comparing twelve different methods on eight real graph classification datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the RGLC method achieves at most and at least 7.8% and 0.8% performance gain at 30% noisy labeling rate, respectively, and reduces the accuracy of privacy attacks to below 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning under Heterophily via Graph Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06344v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (CL) methods learn node representations in a self-supervised manner by maximizing the similarity between the augmented node representations obtained via a GNN-based encoder. However, CL methods perform poorly on graphs with heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes. In this work, we address this problem by proposing an effective graph CL method, namely HLCL, for learning graph representations under heterophily. HLCL first identifies a homophilic and a heterophilic subgraph based on the cosine similarity of node features. It then uses a low-pass and a high-pass graph filter to aggregate representations of nodes connected in the homophilic subgraph and differentiate representations of nodes in the heterophilic subgraph. The final node representations are learned by contrasting both the augmented high-pass filtered views and the augmented low-pass filtered node views. Our extensive experiments show that HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art graph CL methods on benchmark datasets with heterophily, as well as large-scale real-world graphs, by up to 7%, and outperforms graph supervised learning methods on datasets with heterophily by up to 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Road Network Representation Learning with the Third Law of Geography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04038v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road network representation learning aims to learn compressed and effective vectorized representations for road segments that are applicable to numerous tasks. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response, we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority. We provide our codes at https://github.com/gongchenghua/Self-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 findings</p></details> |

Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or model-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the diversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be unreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter the semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a innovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning (DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive sample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation strategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the model effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From the data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using controllable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic information. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing more powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the model's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly perturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These modifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more diverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over traditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

In many science domains such as material performance screening, while feature transformation can model material formula interactions and compositions and discover performance drivers, supervised labels are collected from expensive and lengthy experiments. This issue motivates an Unsupervised Feature Transformation Learning (UFTL) problem. Prior literature, such as manual transformation, supervised feedback guided search, and PCA, either relies on domain knowledge or expensive supervised feedback, or suffers from large search space, or overlooks non-linear feature-feature interactions. UFTL imposes a major challenge on existing methods: how to design a new unsupervised paradigm that captures complex feature interactions and avoids large search space? To fill this gap, we connect graph, contrastive, and generative learning to develop a measurement-pretrain-finetune paradigm for UFTL. For unsupervised feature set utility measurement, we propose a feature value consistency preservation perspective and develop a mean discounted cumulative gain like unsupervised metric to evaluate feature set utility. For unsupervised feature set representation pretraining, we regard a feature set as a feature-feature interaction graph, and develop an unsupervised graph contrastive learning encoder to embed feature sets into vectors. For generative transformation finetuning, we regard a feature set as a feature cross sequence and feature transformation as sequential generation. We develop a deep generative feature transformation model that coordinates the pretrained feature set encoder and the gradient information extracted from a feature set utility evaluator to optimize a transformed feature generator.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, its capacity for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we point out that the traditional optimization of InfoNCE in GCL restricts the cross-domain pairs only to be negative samples, which inevitably enlarges the distribution gap between different domains. This violates the requirement of domain invariance under OOD scenario and consequently impairs the model's OOD generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy "Negative as Positive", where the most semantically similar cross-domain negative pairs are treated as positive during GCL. Our experimental results, spanning a wide array of datasets, confirm that this method substantially improves the OOD generalization performance of GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, In Proceedings of the 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR '24), July 14-18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA</p></details> |
| **[Provable Training for Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13944v4)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a popular training approach for learning node embeddings from augmented graphs without labels. Despite the key principle that maximizing the similarity between positive node pairs while minimizing it between negative node pairs is well established, some fundamental problems are still unclear. Considering the complex graph structure, are some nodes consistently well-trained and following this principle even with different graph augmentations? Or are there some nodes more likely to be untrained across graph augmentations and violate the principle? How to distinguish these nodes and further guide the training of GCL? To answer these questions, we first present experimental evidence showing that the training of GCL is indeed imbalanced across all nodes. To address this problem, we propose the metric "node compactness", which is the lower bound of how a node follows the GCL principle related to the range of augmentations. We further derive the form of node compactness theoretically through bound propagation, which can be integrated into binary cross-entropy as a regularization. To this end, we propose the PrOvable Training (POT) for GCL, which regularizes the training of GCL to encode node embeddings that follows the GCL principle better. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, POT consistently improves the existing GCL approaches, serving as a friendly plugin.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 spotlight.

Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective unsupervised episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is model-agnostic, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task.

However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaseGNN++: Graph Contrastive Learning for Legal Case Retrieval with Graph Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11791v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a specialised information retrieval task that aims to find relevant cases to a given query case. LCR holds pivotal significance in facilitating legal practitioners in finding precedents. Most of existing LCR methods are based on traditional lexical models and language models, which have gained promising performance in retrieval. However, the domain-specific structural information inherent in legal documents is yet to be exploited to further improve the performance. Our previous work CaseGNN successfully harnesses text-attributed graphs and graph neural networks to address the problem of legal structural information neglect. Nonetheless, there remain two aspects for further investigation: (1) The underutilization of rich edge information within text-attributed case graphs limits CaseGNN to generate informative case representation. (2) The inadequacy of labelled data in legal datasets hinders the training of CaseGNN model. In this paper, CaseGNN++, which is extended from CaseGNN, is proposed to simultaneously leverage the edge information and additional label data to discover the latent potential of LCR models. Specifically, an edge feature-based graph attention layer (EUGAT) is proposed to comprehensively update node and edge features during graph modelling, resulting in a full utilisation of structural information of legal cases. Moreover, a novel graph contrastive learning objective with graph augmentation is developed in CaseGNN++ to provide additional training signals, thereby enhancing the legal comprehension capabilities of CaseGNN++ model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that CaseGNN++ not only significantly improves CaseGNN but also achieves supreme performance compared to state-of-the-art LCR methods.

To reduce this annotation burden, we develop an Image-Graph Contrastive Learning framework that pairs chest X-rays with structured report knowledge graphs automatically extracted from radiology notes. Our approach uniquely encodes the disconnected graph components via a relational graph convolution network and transformer attention. In experiments on the CheXpert dataset, this novel graph encoding strategy enabled the framework to outperform existing methods that use image-text contrastive learning in 1% linear evaluation and few-shot settings, while achieving comparable performance to radiologists. By exploiting unlabeled paired images and text, our framework demonstrates the potential of structured clinical insights to enhance contrastive learning for medical images.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on various datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Despite intensive research on deep learning approaches over a decade, there is still a significant performance gap between WSSS and full semantic segmentation. Most current WSSS methods always focus on a limited single image (pixel-wise) information while ignoring the valuable inter-image (semantic-wise) information. From this perspective, a novel end-to-end WSSS framework called DSCNet is developed along with two innovations: i) pixel-wise group contrast and semantic-wise graph contrast are proposed and introduced into the WSSS framework; ii) a novel dual-stream contrastive learning (DSCL) mechanism is designed to jointly handle pixel-wise and semantic-wise context information for better WSSS performance. Specifically, the pixel-wise group contrast learning (PGCL) and semantic-wise graph contrast learning (SGCL) tasks form a more comprehensive solution. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks verify the superiority of DSCNet over SOTA approaches and baseline models.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation is still limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators remain sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (GHGCL). Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks. To reproduce our work, we have open-sourced our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GC-HGNN-E50C.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8figures |
| **[Community-Invariant Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01350v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph augmentation has received great attention in recent years for graph contrastive learning (GCL) to learn well-generalized node/graph representations. However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation, which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level graph information, i.e., the graph community. Moreover, current knowledge-based graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing the model to lack robustness against various types of noise. To address these limitations, this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation. Based on our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph community structure during learnable graph augmentation. By maximizing the spectral changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness. Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of our framework.

Graph contrastive learning aims to learn from high-order collaborative filtering signals with unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, which predominantly relies on the multi-task learning framework involving both the pair-wise recommendation loss and the contrastive loss. This decoupled design can cause inconsistent optimization direction from different losses, which leads to longer convergence time and even sub-optimal performance. Besides, the self-supervised contrastive loss falls short in alleviating the data sparsity issue in RecSys as it learns to differentiate users/items from different views without providing extra supervised collaborative filtering signals during augmentations. In this paper, we propose Mixed Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (MixSGCL) to address these concerns. MixSGCL originally integrates the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a supervised contrastive learning loss to align the two tasks within one optimization direction. To cope with the data sparsity issue, instead unsupervised augmentation, we further propose node-wise and edge-wise mixup to mine more direct supervised collaborative filtering signals based on existing user-item interactions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MixSGCL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving top performance on both accuracy and efficiency. It validates the effectiveness of MixSGCL with our coupled design on supervised graph contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGCL: Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning For Event Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15612v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting events such as political protests, flu epidemics, and criminal activities is crucial to proactively taking necessary measures and implementing required responses to address emerging challenges. Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for event prediction on six real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Dimensional Rationale in Graph Contrastive Learning from Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10401v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning is a general learning paradigm excelling at capturing invariant information from diverse perturbations in graphs. Recent works focus on exploring the structural rationale from graphs, thereby increasing the discriminability of the invariant information. However, such methods may incur in the mis-learning of graph models towards the interpretability of graphs, and thus the learned noisy and task-agnostic information interferes with the prediction of graphs. To this end, with the purpose of exploring the intrinsic rationale of graphs, we accordingly propose to capture the dimensional rationale from graphs, which has not received sufficient attention in the literature. The conducted exploratory experiments attest to the feasibility of the aforementioned roadmap. To elucidate the innate mechanism behind the performance improvement arising from the dimensional rationale, we rethink the dimensional rationale in graph contrastive learning from a causal perspective and further formalize the causality among the variables in the pre-training stage to build the corresponding structural causal model. On the basis of the understanding of the structural causal model, we propose the dimensional rationale-aware graph contrastive learning approach, which introduces a learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network and a redundancy reduction constraint. The learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network is updated by leveraging a bi-level meta-learning technique, and the redundancy reduction constraint disentangles the redundant features through a decorrelation process during learning. Empirically, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method can yield significant performance boosts on various benchmarks with respect to discriminability and transferability. The code implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/ByronJi/DRGCL.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2024 |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Meta-path Contexts and Adaptively Weighted Negative Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13847v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph contrastive learning has received wide attention recently. Some existing methods use meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects, to construct contrastive views. However, most of them ignore the rich meta-path context information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths. Further, they fail to distinguish negative samples, which could adversely affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, which considers both meta-path contexts and weighted negative samples. Specifically, MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses meta-path contexts and characterizes details on how the objects are connected. Then, we theoretically analyze the InfoNCE loss and recognize its limitations for computing gradients of negative samples. To better distinguish negative samples, we learn hard-valued weights for them based on node clustering and use prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same cluster. In addition, we propose a variant model AdaMEOW that adaptively learns soft-valued weights of negative samples to further improve node representation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of MEOW and AdaMEOW against other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TKDE as a regular paper</p></details> |
| **[CGCL: Collaborative Graph Contrastive Learning without Handcrafted Graph Data Augmentations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03262v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised graph representation learning is a non-trivial topic. The success of contrastive methods in the unsupervised representation learning on structured data inspires similar attempts on the graph. Existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn the invariance across multiple augmentation views, which renders it heavily reliant on the handcrafted graph augmentations. However, inappropriate graph data augmentations can potentially jeopardize such invariance. In this paper, we show the potential hazards of inappropriate augmentations and then propose a novel Collaborative Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CGCL). This framework harnesses multiple graph encoders to observe the graph. Features observed from different encoders serve as the contrastive views in contrastive learning, which avoids inducing unstable perturbation and guarantees the invariance. To ensure the collaboration among diverse graph encoders, we propose the concepts of asymmetric architecture and complementary encoders as the design principle. To further prove the rationality, we utilize two quantitative metrics to measure the assembly of CGCL respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of CGCL in unsupervised graph-level representation learning and the potential of collaborative framework.

It mines explicit features in unannotated graphs to generate favorable graph representations for downstream tasks. Most existing GCL methods focus on the design of graph augmentation strategies and mutual information estimation operations. Graph augmentation produces augmented views by graph perturbations. These views preserve a locally similar structure and exploit explicit features. However, these methods have not considered the interaction existing in subgraphs. To explore the impact of substructure interactions on graph representations, we propose a novel framework called subgraph network-based contrastive learning (SGNCL). SGNCL applies a subgraph network generation strategy to produce augmented views. This strategy converts the original graph into an Edge-to-Node mapping network with both topological and attribute features. The single-shot augmented view is a first-order subgraph network that mines the interaction between nodes, node-edge, and edges. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the second-order subgraph augmentation on mining graph structure interactions, and further, propose a contrastive objective that fuses the first-order and second-order subgraph information. We compare SGNCL with classical and state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmark datasets of different domains. Extensive experiments show that SGNCL achieves competitive or better performance (top three) on all datasets in unsupervised learning settings. Furthermore, SGNCL achieves the best average gain of 6.9\% in transfer learning compared to the best method. Finally, experiments also demonstrate that mining substructure interactions have positive implications for graph contrastive learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[EG-ConMix: An Intrusion Detection Method based on Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17980v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of IoT devices increases, security concerns become more prominent. The impact of threats can be minimized by deploying Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) by monitoring network traffic, detecting and discovering intrusions, and issuing security alerts promptly. Most intrusion detection research in recent years has been directed towards the pair of traffic itself without considering the interrelationships among them, thus limiting the monitoring of complex IoT network attack events. Besides, anomalous traffic in real networks accounts for only a small fraction, which leads to a severe imbalance problem in the dataset that makes algorithmic learning and prediction extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose an EG-ConMix method based on E-GraphSAGE, incorporating a data augmentation module to fix the problem of data imbalance. In addition, we incorporate contrastive learning to discern the difference between normal and malicious traffic samples, facilitating the extraction of key features. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior intrusion detection performance of EG-ConMix compared to state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, it exhibits significant advantages in terms of training speed and accuracy for large-scale graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15075v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods utilize graph contrastive Learning within graph-structured user-item interaction data for collaborative filtering and have demonstrated their efficacy in recommendation tasks. However, they ignore that the difference relation density of nodes between the user- and item-side causes the adaptability of graphs on bilateral nodes to be different after multi-hop graph interaction calculation, which limits existing models to achieve ideal results. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework for recommendation tasks called Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning (BusGCL) that consider the bilateral unsymmetry on user-item node relation density for sliced user and item graph reasoning better with bilateral slicing contrastive training. Especially, taking into account the aggregation ability of hypergraph-based graph convolutional network (GCN) in digging implicit similarities is more suitable for user nodes, embeddings generated from three different modules: hypergraph-based GCN, GCN and perturbed GCN, are sliced into two subviews by the user- and item-side respectively, and selectively combined into subview pairs bilaterally based on the characteristics of inter-node relation structure. Furthermore, to align the distribution of user and item embeddings after aggregation, a dispersing loss is leveraged to adjust the mutual distance between all embeddings for maintaining learning ability. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets have proved the superiority of BusGCL in comparison to various recommendation methods. Other models can simply utilize our bilateral slicing contrastive learning to enhance recommending performance without incurring extra expenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Ranking Contrastive Learning: A Extremely Simple yet Efficient Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14525v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a representative graph self-supervised method, achieving significant success. The currently prevalent optimization objective for GCL is InfoNCE. Typically, it employs augmentation techniques to obtain two views, where a node in one view acts as the anchor, the corresponding node in the other view serves as the positive sample, and all other nodes are regarded as negative samples. The goal is to minimize the distance between the anchor node and positive samples and maximize the distance to negative samples. However, due to the lack of label information during training, InfoNCE inevitably treats samples from the same class as negative samples, leading to the issue of false negative samples. This can impair the learned node representations and subsequently hinder performance in downstream tasks. While numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate the impact of false negatives, they still face various challenges. For instance, while increasing the number of negative samples can dilute the impact of false negatives, it concurrently increases computational burden. Thus, we propose GraphRank, a simple yet efficient graph contrastive learning method that addresses the problem of false negative samples by redefining the concept of negative samples to a certain extent, thereby avoiding the issue of false negative samples. The effectiveness of GraphRank is empirically validated through experiments on the node, edge, and graph level tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to potential implicit data leakage in our experimental setup, where the pretraining dataset was ordered by default labels, we withdraw this manuscript for further self-examination and rigorous validation</p></details> |

By engaging in pretext tasks to learn the intricate topological structures and properties of graphs using unlabeled data, these graph SSL models achieve enhanced performance, improved generalization, and heightened robustness. Despite the remarkable achievements of these graph SSL methods, their current implementation poses significant challenges for beginners and practitioners due to the complex nature of graph structures, inconsistent evaluation metrics, and concerns regarding reproducibility hinder further progress in this field. Recognizing the growing interest within the research community, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and accessible toolkit consisting of the most representative graph SSL algorithms. To address these challenges, we present a Graph SSL toolkit named PyG-SSL, which is built upon PyTorch and is compatible with various deep learning and scientific computing backends. Within the toolkit, we offer a unified framework encompassing dataset loading, hyper-parameter configuration, model training, and comprehensive performance evaluation for diverse downstream tasks. Moreover, we provide beginner-friendly tutorials and the best hyper-parameters of each graph SSL algorithm on different graph datasets, facilitating the reproduction of results.

However, the easy-to-plug-in nature of such encoders makes them vulnerable to copyright infringement. To address this issue, we develop a novel watermarking framework to protect graph encoders in GSSL settings. The key idea is to force the encoder to map a set of specially crafted trigger instances into a unique compact cluster in the outputted embedding space during model pre-training. Consequently, when the encoder is stolen and concatenated with any downstream classifiers, the resulting model inherits the `backdoor' of the encoder and predicts the trigger instances to be in a single category with high probability regardless of the ground truth. Experimental results have shown that, the embedded watermark can be transferred to various downstream tasks in black-box settings, including node classification, link prediction and community detection, which forms a reliable watermark verification system for GSSL in reality. This approach also shows satisfactory performance in terms of model fidelity, reliability and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the latest version (see highlighted content, slight different from the final version submitted to IEEE Xplore)</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Augmentation for Contrast-based Graph Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19600v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning has prominently featured an intensified exploration of spectral cues. Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph's spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that simple edge perturbations - random edge dropping for node-level and random edge adding for graph-level self-supervised learning - consistently yield comparable or superior performance while being significantly more computationally efficient. This suggests that the computational overhead of sophisticated spectral augmentations may not justify their practical benefits. Our theoretical analysis of the InfoNCE loss bounds for shallow GNNs further supports this observation. The proposed insights represent a significant leap forward in the field, potentially refining the understanding and implementation of graph self-supervised learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Over the past few years, GAEs have gained significant attention in academia and industry. In particular, the recent advent of GAEs with masked autoencoding schemes marks a significant advancement in graph self-supervised learning research. While numerous GAEs have been proposed, the underlying mechanisms of GAEs are not well understood, and a comprehensive benchmark for GAEs is still lacking. In this work, we bridge the gap between GAEs and contrastive learning by establishing conceptual and methodological connections. We revisit the GAEs studied in previous works and demonstrate how contrastive learning principles can be applied to GAEs. Motivated by these insights, we introduce lrGAE (left-right GAE), a general and powerful GAE framework that leverages contrastive learning principles to learn meaningful representations.

The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrap Latents of Nodes and Neighbors for Graph Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05087v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning is a significant paradigm in graph self-supervised learning. However, it requires negative samples to prevent model collapse and learn discriminative representations. These negative samples inevitably lead to heavy computation, memory overhead and class collision, compromising the representation learning. Recent studies present that methods obviating negative samples can attain competitive performance and scalability enhancements, exemplified by bootstrapped graph latents (BGRL). However, BGRL neglects the inherent graph homophily, which provides valuable insights into underlying positive pairs. Our motivation arises from the observation that subtly introducing a few ground-truth positive pairs significantly improves BGRL. Although we can't obtain ground-truth positive pairs without labels under the self-supervised setting, edges in the graph can reflect noisy positive pairs, i.e., neighboring nodes often share the same label. Therefore, we propose to expand the positive pair set with node-neighbor pairs. Subsequently, we introduce a cross-attention module to predict the supportiveness score of a neighbor with respect to the anchor node. This score quantifies the positive support from each neighboring node, and is encoded into the training objective. Consequently, our method mitigates class collision from negative and noisy positive samples, concurrently enhancing intra-class compactness. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets and three downstream task node classification, node clustering, and node similarity search. The results demonstrate that our method generates node representations with enhanced intra-class compactness and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML PKDD 2024</p></details> |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |

Yet, a significant challenge in graph SSL lies in the feature discrepancy among graphs across different domains. In this work, we aim to pretrain one graph neural network (GNN) on a varied collection of graphs endowed with rich node features and subsequently apply the pretrained GNN to unseen graphs. We present a general GraphAlign method that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing graph SSL framework. To align feature distributions across disparate graphs, GraphAlign designs alignment strategies of feature encoding, normalization, alongside a mixture-of-feature-expert module. Extensive experiments show that GraphAlign empowers existing graph SSL frameworks to pretrain a unified and powerful GNN across multiple graphs, showcasing performance superiority on both in-domain and out-of-domain graphs.</p></details> |  |

Despite the potential for deeper insights, existing TAG representation learning primarily relies on supervised methods, necessitating extensive labeled data and limiting applicability across diverse contexts. This paper introduces a new self-supervised learning framework, Text-And-Graph Multi-View Alignment (TAGA), which overcomes these constraints by integrating TAGs' structural and semantic dimensions. TAGA constructs two complementary views: Text-of-Graph view, which organizes node texts into structured documents based on graph topology, and the Graph-of-Text view, which converts textual nodes and connections into graph data. By aligning representations from both views, TAGA captures joint textual and structural information. In addition, a novel structure-preserving random walk algorithm is proposed for efficient training on large-sized TAGs. Our framework demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios across eight real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Correlations of Self-Supervised Tasks for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04245v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph self-supervised learning has sparked a research surge in training informative representations without accessing any labeled data. However, our understanding of graph self-supervised learning remains limited, and the inherent relationships between various self-supervised tasks are still unexplored. Our paper aims to provide a fresh understanding of graph self-supervised learning based on task correlations. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the representations trained by one specific task on other tasks and define correlation values to quantify task correlations. Through this process, we unveil the task correlations between various self-supervised tasks and can measure their expressive capabilities, which are closely related to downstream performance. By analyzing the correlation values between tasks across various datasets, we reveal the complexity of task correlations and the limitations of existing multi-task learning methods. To obtain more capable representations, we propose Graph Task Correlation Modeling (GraphTCM) to illustrate the task correlations and utilize it to enhance graph self-supervised training. The experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2024 Accepted |

To mitigate the scalability of non-contrastive graph SSL, we propose a novel approach to reduce the cost of computing the covariance matrix for the pre-training loss function with volume-maximization terms. Our work focuses on reducing the cost associated with the loss computation via graph node or dimension sampling. We provide theoretical insight into why dimension sampling would result in accurate loss computations and support it with mathematical derivation of the novel approach. We develop our experimental setup on the node-level graph prediction tasks, where SSL pre-training has shown to be difficult due to the large size of real world graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that the cost associated with the loss computation can be reduced via node or dimension sampling without lowering the downstream performance. Our results demonstrate that sampling mostly results in improved downstream performance. Ablation studies and experimental analysis are provided to untangle the role of the different factors in the experimental setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Masked Autoencoders through Alignment and Uniformity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07225v1)** | 2024-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning on graphs can be bifurcated into contrastive and generative methods. Contrastive methods, also known as graph contrastive learning (GCL), have dominated graph self-supervised learning in the past few years, but the recent advent of graph masked autoencoder (GraphMAE) rekindles the momentum behind generative methods. Despite the empirical success of GraphMAE, there is still a dearth of theoretical understanding regarding its efficacy. Moreover, while both generative and contrastive methods have been shown to be effective, their connections and differences have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we theoretically build a bridge between GraphMAE and GCL, and prove that the node-level reconstruction objective in GraphMAE implicitly performs context-level GCL. Based on our theoretical analysis, we further identify the limitations of the GraphMAE from the perspectives of alignment and uniformity, which have been considered as two key properties of high-quality representations in GCL. We point out that GraphMAE's alignment performance is restricted by the masking strategy, and the uniformity is not strictly guaranteed. To remedy the aforementioned limitations, we propose an Alignment-Uniformity enhanced Graph Masked AutoEncoder, named AUG-MAE. Specifically, we propose an easy-to-hard adversarial masking strategy to provide hard-to-align samples, which improves the alignment performance. Meanwhile, we introduce an explicit uniformity regularizer to ensure the uniformity of the learned representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Masked Graph Autoencoder with Non-discrete Bandwidths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03814v1)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked graph autoencoders have emerged as a powerful graph self-supervised learning method that has yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we unveil that the existing discrete edge masking and binary link reconstruction strategies are insufficient to learn topologically informative representations, from the perspective of message propagation on graph neural networks. These limitations include blocking message flows, vulnerability to over-smoothness, and suboptimal neighborhood discriminability. Inspired by these understandings, we explore non-discrete edge masks, which are sampled from a continuous and dispersive probability distribution instead of the discrete Bernoulli distribution. These masks restrict the amount of output messages for each edge, referred to as "bandwidths". We propose a novel, informative, and effective topological masked graph autoencoder using bandwidth masking and a layer-wise bandwidth prediction objective. We demonstrate its powerful graph topological learning ability both theoretically and empirically. Our proposed framework outperforms representative baselines in both self-supervised link prediction (improving the discrete edge reconstructors by at most 20%) and node classification on numerous datasets, solely with a structure-learning pretext. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Newiz430/Bandana.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version (17 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables), accepted by TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Graph Contrastive Learning via Graph Message Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03638v1)** | 2024-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning is usually performed by first conducting Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) and then employing a contrastive learning pipeline to train GNNs. As we know that GDA is an important issue for graph contrastive learning. Various GDAs have been developed recently which mainly involve dropping or perturbing edges, nodes, node attributes and edge attributes. However, to our knowledge, it still lacks a universal and effective augmentor that is suitable for different types of graph data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first introduce the graph message representation of graph data. Based on it, we then propose a novel Graph Message Augmentation (GMA), a universal scheme for reformulating many existing GDAs. The proposed unified GMA not only gives a new perspective to understand many existing GDAs but also provides a universal and more effective graph data augmentation for graph self-supervised learning tasks. Moreover, GMA introduces an easy way to implement the mixup augmentor which is natural for images but usually challengeable for graphs. Based on the proposed GMA, we then propose a unified graph contrastive learning, termed Graph Message Contrastive Learning (GMCL), that employs attribution-guided universal GMA for graph contrastive learning. Experiments on many graph learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed GMA and GMCL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Simplifying Bootstrapped Graph Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02619v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a representative paradigm in graph self-supervised learning, where negative samples are commonly regarded as the key to preventing model collapse and producing distinguishable representations. Recent studies have shown that GCL without negative samples can achieve state-of-the-art performance as well as scalability improvement, with bootstrapped graph latent (BGRL) as a prominent step forward. However, BGRL relies on a complex architecture to maintain the ability to scatter representations, and the underlying mechanisms enabling the success remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce an instance-level decorrelation perspective to tackle the aforementioned issue and leverage it as a springboard to reveal the potential unnecessary model complexity within BGRL. Based on our findings, we present SGCL, a simple yet effective GCL framework that utilizes the outputs from two consecutive iterations as positive pairs, eliminating the negative samples. SGCL only requires a single graph augmentation and a single graph encoder without additional parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on various graph benchmarks demonstrate that SGCL can achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters, lower time and space costs, and significant convergence speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WSDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Generative and Contrastive Paradigms Are Complementary for Graph Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15523v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For graph self-supervised learning (GSSL), masked autoencoder (MAE) follows the generative paradigm and learns to reconstruct masked graph edges or node features. Contrastive Learning (CL) maximizes the similarity between augmented views of the same graph and is widely used for GSSL. However, MAE and CL are considered separately in existing works for GSSL. We observe that the MAE and CL paradigms are complementary and propose the graph contrastive masked autoencoder (GCMAE) framework to unify them. Specifically, by focusing on local edges or node features, MAE cannot capture global information of the graph and is sensitive to particular edges and features. On the contrary, CL excels in extracting global information because it considers the relation between graphs. As such, we equip GCMAE with an MAE branch and a CL branch, and the two branches share a common encoder, which allows the MAE branch to exploit the global information extracted by the CL branch. To force GCMAE to capture global graph structures, we train it to reconstruct the entire adjacency matrix instead of only the masked edges as in existing works. Moreover, a discrimination loss is proposed for feature reconstruction, which improves the disparity between node embeddings rather than reducing the reconstruction error to tackle the feature smoothing problem of MAE. We evaluate GCMAE on four popular graph tasks (i.e., node classification, node clustering, link prediction, and graph classification) and compare with 14 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that GCMAE consistently provides good accuracy across these tasks, and the maximum accuracy improvement is up to 3.2% compared with the best-performing baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Self-Supervised Learning for Molecular Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08005v3)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL) provides a robust pathway for acquiring embeddings without expert labelling, a capability that carries profound implications for molecular graphs due to the staggering number of potential molecules and the high cost of obtaining labels. However, GSSL methods are designed not for optimisation within a specific domain but rather for transferability across a variety of downstream tasks. This broad applicability complicates their evaluation. Addressing this challenge, we present "Molecular Graph Representation Evaluation" (MOLGRAPHEVAL), generating detailed profiles of molecular graph embeddings with interpretable and diversified attributes. MOLGRAPHEVAL offers a suite of probing tasks grouped into three categories: (i) generic graph, (ii) molecular substructure, and (iii) embedding space properties. By leveraging MOLGRAPHEVAL to benchmark existing GSSL methods against both current downstream datasets and our suite of tasks, we uncover significant inconsistencies between inferences drawn solely from existing datasets and those derived from more nuanced probing. These findings suggest that current evaluation methodologies fail to capture the entirety of the landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready, NeurIPS Benchmark 2023</p></details> |
| **[Group Identification via Transitional Hypergraph Convolution with Cross-view Self-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08620v1)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of social media, a growing number of users search for and join group activities in their daily life. This develops a need for the study on the group identification (GI) task, i.e., recommending groups to users. The major challenge in this task is how to predict users' preferences for groups based on not only previous group participation of users but also users' interests in items. Although recent developments in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) accomplish embedding multiple types of objects in graph-based recommender systems, they, however, fail to address this GI problem comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Group Identification via Transitional Hypergraph Convolution with Graph Self-supervised Learning (GTGS). We devise a novel transitional hypergraph convolution layer to leverage users' preferences for items as prior knowledge when seeking their group preferences. To construct comprehensive user/group representations for GI task, we design the cross-view self-supervised learning to encourage the intrinsic consistency between item and group preferences for each user, and the group-based regularization to enhance the distinction among group embeddings. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the superiority of GTGS. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

| **[Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning via Neighborhood Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13964v3)** | 2023-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach in the realm of graph self-supervised learning. Prevailing GCL methods mainly derive from the principles of contrastive learning in the field of computer vision: modeling invariance by specifying absolutely similar pairs. However, when applied to graph data, this paradigm encounters two significant limitations: (1) the validity of the generated views cannot be guaranteed: graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and intrinsic topology of graph data; (2) specifying absolutely similar pairs in the graph views is unreliable: for abstract and non-Euclidean graph data, it is difficult for humans to decide the absolute similarity and dissimilarity intuitively. Despite the notable performance of current GCL methods, these challenges necessitate a reevaluation: Could GCL be more effectively tailored to the intrinsic properties of graphs, rather than merely adopting principles from computer vision? In response to this query, we propose a novel paradigm, Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL). This approach facilitates GCL via neighborhood ranking, avoiding the need to specify absolutely similar pairs. GSCL leverages the underlying graph characteristic of diminishing label consistency, asserting that nodes that are closer in the graph are overall more similar than far-distant nodes. Within the GSCL framework, we introduce pairwise and listwise gated ranking InfoNCE loss functions to effectively preserve the relative similarity ranking within neighborhoods. Moreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops considered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency. Our extensive empirical results across 11 commonly used graph datasets-including 8 homophily graphs and 3 heterophily graphs-demonstrate GSCL's superior performance compared to 20 SOTA GCL methods.</p></details> |  |

However, developing robust and accurate feature matching techniques faces challenges due to the lack of discriminative texture and significant variability between patients.

Among both sets of graph SSL techniques, the masked graph autoencoders (e.g., GraphMAE)--one type of generative method--have recently produced promising results. The idea behind this is to reconstruct the node features (or structures)--that are randomly masked from the input--with the autoencoder architecture. However, the performance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the discriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance in the features. In this paper, we present a masked self-supervised learning framework GraphMAE2 with the goal of overcoming this issue. The idea is to impose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we design the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent representation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The multi-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into reconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction is to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments show that GraphMAE2 can consistently generate top results on various public datasets, including at least 2.45% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on ogbn-Papers100M with 111M nodes and 1.6B edges.</p></details> | Accepted to WWW'23 |
| **[Link Prediction with Non-Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14394v2)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent focal area in the space of graph neural networks (GNNs) is graph self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to derive useful node representations without labeled data. Notably, many state-of-the-art graph SSL methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and negative samples to learn node representations. Owing to challenges in negative sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the training graph and use this analysis to propose T-BGRL, a novel non-contrastive framework that incorporates cheap corruptions to improve the generalization ability of the model. This simple modification strongly improves inductive performance in 5/6 of our datasets, with up to a 120% improvement in Hits@50--all with comparable speed to other non-contrastive baselines and up to 14x faster than the best-performing contrastive baseline. Our work imparts interesting findings about non-contrastive learning for link prediction and paves the way for future researchers to further expand upon this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2023. 19 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, most existing methods focus on unsupervised learning tasks only and very few work has shown its superiority over the state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning (GCL) models, especially on the classification task. While a very recent model has been proposed to bridge the gap, its performance on unsupervised learning tasks is still unknown. In this paper, to comprehensively enhance the performance of generative graph SSL against other GCL models on both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, we propose the SeeGera model, which is based on the family of self-supervised variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE). Specifically, SeeGera adopts the semi-implicit variational inference framework, a hierarchical variational framework, and mainly focuses on feature reconstruction and structure/feature masking. On the one hand, SeeGera co-embeds both nodes and features in the encoder and reconstructs both links and features in the decoder. Since feature embeddings contain rich semantic information on features, they can be combined with node embeddings to provide fine-grained knowledge for feature reconstruction. On the other hand, SeeGera adds an additional layer for structure/feature masking to the hierarchical variational framework, which boosts the model generalizability. We conduct extensive experiments comparing SeeGera with 9 other state-of-the-art competitors. Our results show that SeeGera can compare favorably against other state-of-the-art GCL methods in a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WebConf 2023</p></details> |

This problem has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing real-world applications, such as product categorization for newly added commodity categories on an E-commerce platform with scarce records or diagnoses for rare diseases on a patient similarity graph. To tackle such challenging label scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has become a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently, inspired by the development of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node embeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to meta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate the potential of an alternative framework, \textit{Transductive Linear Probing}, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from graph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot node classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic self-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed due to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even without any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with self-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the state-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same protocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification problems and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances on graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the First Learning on Graph Conference (LoG 2022)</p></details> |
| **[Alleviating neighbor bias: augmenting graph self-supervise learning with structural equivalent positive samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04365v1)** | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, using a self-supervised learning framework to learn the general characteristics of graphs has been considered a promising paradigm for graph representation learning. The core of self-supervised learning strategies for graph neural networks lies in constructing suitable positive sample selection strategies. However, existing GNNs typically aggregate information from neighboring nodes to update node representations, leading to an over-reliance on neighboring positive samples, i.e., homophilous samples; while ignoring long-range positive samples, i.e., positive samples that are far apart on the graph but structurally equivalent samples, a problem we call "neighbor bias." This neighbor bias can reduce the generalization performance of GNNs. In this paper, we argue that the generalization properties of GNNs should be determined by combining homogeneous samples and structurally equivalent samples, which we call the "GC combination hypothesis." Therefore, we propose a topological signal-driven self-supervised method. It uses a topological information-guided structural equivalence sampling strategy. First, we extract multiscale topological features using persistent homology. Then we compute the structural equivalence of node pairs based on their topological features. In particular, we design a topological loss function to pull in non-neighboring node pairs with high structural equivalence in the representation space to alleviate neighbor bias. Finally, we use the joint training mechanism to adjust the effect of structural equivalence on the model to fit datasets with different characteristics. We conducted experiments on the node classification task across seven graph datasets. The results show that the model performance can be effectively improved using a strategy of topological signal enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

MMMAs attract fraudsters and some cybercriminals provide support for frauds via black market accounts (BMAs).

This paper illustrates our BMA detection system SGRL (Self-supervised Graph Representation Learning) used in WeChat, a representative MMMA with over a billion users. We tailor Graph Neural Network and Graph Self-supervised Learning in SGRL for BMA detection. The workflow of SGRL contains a pretraining phase that utilizes structural information, node attribute information and available human knowledge, and a lightweight detection phase. In offline experiments, SGRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 16.06%-58.17% on offline evaluation measures. We deploy SGRL in the online environment to detect BMAs on the billion-scale WeChat graph, and it exceeds the alternative by 7.27% on the online evaluation measure. In conclusion, SGRL can alleviate label reliance, generalize well to unseen data, and effectively detect BMAs in WeChat.</p></details> | <details><summary>WSDM ...</summary><p>WSDM 2023.

However, most of the existing graph neural networks (GNNs) heavily rely on labeling information, which is normally expensive to obtain in the real world. Although some existing works aim to effectively learn graph representations in an unsupervised manner, they suffer from certain limitations, such as the heavy reliance on monotone contrastiveness and limited scalability. To overcome the aforementioned problems, we introduce a novel self-supervised graph representation learning algorithm via Graph Contrastive Adjusted Zooming, namely G-Zoom, to learn node representations by leveraging the proposed adjusted zooming scheme. Specifically, this mechanism enables G-Zoom to explore and extract self-supervision signals from a graph from multiple scales: micro (i.e., node-level), meso (i.e., neighborhood-level), and macro (i.e., subgraph-level). Firstly, we generate two augmented views of the input graph via two different graph augmentations. Then, we establish three different contrastiveness on the above three scales progressively, from node, neighboring, to subgraph level, where we maximize the agreement between graph representations across scales. While we can extract valuable clues from a given graph on the micro and macro perspectives, the neighboring-level contrastiveness offers G-Zoom the capability of a customizable option based on our adjusted zooming scheme to manually choose an optimal viewpoint that lies between the micro and macro perspectives to better understand the graph data. Additionally, to make our model scalable to large graphs, we employ a parallel graph diffusion approach to decouple model training from the graph size. We have conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning with Cross-view Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07699v3)** | 2022-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among different existing graph self-supervised learning strategies, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been one of the most prevalent approaches to this problem. Despite the remarkable performance those GCL methods have achieved, existing GCL methods that heavily depend on various manually designed augmentation techniques still struggle to alleviate the feature suppression issue without risking losing task-relevant information. Consequently, the learned representation is either brittle or unilluminating. In light of this, we introduce the Graph Contrastive Learning with Cross-View Reconstruction (GraphCV), which follows the information bottleneck principle to learn minimal yet sufficient representation from graph data. Specifically, GraphCV aims to elicit the predictive (useful for downstream instance discrimination) and other non-predictive features separately. Except for the conventional contrastive loss which guarantees the consistency and sufficiency of the representation across different augmentation views, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction mechanism to pursue the disentanglement of the two learned representations. Besides, an adversarial view perturbed from the original view is added as the third view for the contrastive loss to guarantee the intactness of the global semantics and improve the representation robustness. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on graph classification task over multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Self-supervised Learning with Accurate Discrepancy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02989v5)** | 2022-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNNs) aims to learn an accurate representation of the graphs in an unsupervised manner, to obtain transferable representations of them for diverse downstream tasks. Predictive learning and contrastive learning are the two most prevalent approaches for graph self-supervised learning. However, they have their own drawbacks. While the predictive learning methods can learn the contextual relationships between neighboring nodes and edges, they cannot learn global graph-level similarities. Contrastive learning, while it can learn global graph-level similarities, its objective to maximize the similarity between two differently perturbed graphs may result in representations that cannot discriminate two similar graphs with different properties. To tackle such limitations, we propose a framework that aims to learn the exact discrepancy between the original and the perturbed graphs, coined as Discrepancy-based Self-supervised LeArning (D-SLA). Specifically, we create multiple perturbations of the given graph with varying degrees of similarity, and train the model to predict whether each graph is the original graph or the perturbed one. Moreover, we further aim to accurately capture the amount of discrepancy for each perturbed graph using the graph edit distance. We validate our D-SLA on various graph-related downstream tasks, including molecular property prediction, protein function prediction, and link prediction tasks, on which ours largely outperforms relevant baselines.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 |
| **[Automated Graph Self-supervised Learning via Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02099v1)** | 2022-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning on graphs has recently achieved remarkable success in graph representation learning. With hundreds of self-supervised pretext tasks proposed over the past few years, the research community has greatly developed, and the key is no longer to design more powerful but complex pretext tasks, but to make more effective use of those already on hand. This paper studies the problem of how to automatically, adaptively, and dynamically learn instance-level self-supervised learning strategies for each node from a given pool of pretext tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework for Automated Graph Self-Supervised Learning (AGSSL), which consists of two main branches: (i) Knowledge Extraction: training multiple teachers with different pretext tasks, so as to extract different levels of knowledge with different inductive biases; (ii) Knowledge Integration: integrating different levels of knowledge and distilling them into the student model. Without simply treating different teachers as equally important, we provide a provable theoretical guideline for how to integrate the knowledge of different teachers, i.e., the integrated teacher probability should be close to the true Bayesian class-probability. To approach the theoretical optimum in practice, two adaptive knowledge integration strategies are proposed to construct a relatively "good" integrated teacher. Extensive experiments on eight datasets show that AGSSL can benefit from multiple pretext tasks, outperforming the corresponding individual tasks; by combining a few simple but classical pretext tasks, the resulting performance is comparable to other leading counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Node Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06743v1)** | 2022-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning graph representations and thus facilitating various graph-related tasks. However, most GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always feasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled data. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing attention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for self-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by contrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes (negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive samples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are uniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal objective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of positive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive sample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would inevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics with the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this work, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned issues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all positive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then transformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling positive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node similarity and derive the enhanced objective. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced objective under different settings.</p></details> |  |

In graph contrastive learning, benchmark methods apply various graph augmentation approaches. However, most of the augmentation methods are non-learnable, which causes the issue of generating unbeneficial augmented graphs. Such augmentation may degenerate the representation ability of graph contrastive learning methods. Therefore, we motivate our method to generate augmented graph by a learnable graph augmenter, called MEta Graph Augmentation (MEGA). We then clarify that a "good" graph augmentation must have uniformity at the instance-level and informativeness at the feature-level. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learning a graph augmenter that can generate an augmentation with uniformity and informativeness. The objective of the graph augmenter is to promote our feature extraction network to learn a more discriminative feature representation, which motivates us to propose a meta-learning paradigm. Empirically, the experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in graph self-supervised learning tasks. Further experimental studies prove the effectiveness of different terms of MEGA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2022</p></details> |

We discuss the use of dual embodied-symbolic concept representations for molecular graph representation learning, specifically with exemplar-based contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL). The embodied representations are learned from molecular graphs, and the symbolic representations are learned from the corresponding Chemical knowledge graph (KG). We use the Chemical KG to enhance molecular graphs with symbolic (semantic) knowledge and generate their augmented molecular graphs. We treat a molecular graph and its semantically augmented molecular graph as exemplars of the same semantic class, and use the pairs as positive pairs in exemplar-based contrastive SSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Self-Supervised Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00111v5)** | 2022-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning on graphs has attracted significant interests recently. However, most of the works have focused on (semi-) supervised learning, resulting in shortcomings including heavy label reliance, poor generalization, and weak robustness. To address these issues, self-supervised learning (SSL), which extracts informative knowledge through well-designed pretext tasks without relying on manual labels, has become a promising and trending learning paradigm for graph data. Different from SSL on other domains like computer vision and natural language processing, SSL on graphs has an exclusive background, design ideas, and taxonomies. Under the umbrella of graph self-supervised learning, we present a timely and comprehensive review of the existing approaches which employ SSL techniques for graph data. We construct a unified framework that mathematically formalizes the paradigm of graph SSL. According to the objectives of pretext tasks, we divide these approaches into four categories: generation-based, auxiliary property-based, contrast-based, and hybrid approaches. We further describe the applications of graph SSL across various research fields and summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation benchmark, performance comparison and open-source codes of graph SSL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and potential future directions in this research field.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[FastGCL: Fast Self-Supervised Learning on Graphs via Contrastive Neighborhood Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00905v1)** | 2022-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL), as a popular approach to graph self-supervised learning, has recently achieved a non-negligible effect. To achieve superior performance, the majority of existing GCL methods elaborate on graph data augmentation to construct appropriate contrastive pairs. However, existing methods place more emphasis on the complex graph data augmentation which requires extra time overhead, and pay less attention to developing contrastive schemes specific to encoder characteristics. We argue that a better contrastive scheme should be tailored to the characteristics of graph neural networks (e.g., neighborhood aggregation) and propose a simple yet effective method named FastGCL. Specifically, by constructing weighted-aggregated and non-aggregated neighborhood information as positive and negative samples respectively, FastGCL identifies the potential semantic information of data without disturbing the graph topology and node attributes, resulting in faster training and convergence speeds. Extensive experiments have been conducted on node classification and graph classification tasks, showing that FastGCL has competitive classification performance and significant training speedup compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Self-Supervised Learning for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05470v3)** | 2022-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph self-supervised learning has gained increasing attention due to its capacity to learn expressive node representations. Many pretext tasks, or loss functions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe that different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross datasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph self-supervised learning. Different from existing works focusing on designing single pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically leverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating representations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to ground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle, we make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or the principle that "like attracts like," as the guidance to effectively search various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical understanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in this search task. Then we propose the AutoSSL framework which can automatically search over combinations of various self-supervised tasks. By evaluating the framework on 7 real-world datasets, our experimental results show that AutoSSL can significantly boost the performance on downstream tasks including node clustering and node classification compared with training under individual tasks.

We first propose a graph attention self-supervised learning algorithm (GASSL) to detect the HUAVs of a single UAV cluster, where the GASSL can fit the IFS at the same time. Then, to detect the HUAVs in the USNET with multiple UAV clusters, we develop a multi-cluster graph attention self-supervised learning algorithm (MC-GASSL) based on the GASSL. The MC-GASSL clusters the USNET with a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based metric learning scheme and finds the HUAVs in each cluster with GASSL. Numerical results show that the GASSL can detect the HUAVs in single UAV clusters obeying various kinds of IFSs with over 98% average accuracy. The simulation results also show that the clustering purity of the USNET with MC-GASSL exceeds that with traditional clustering algorithms by at least 10% average. Furthermore, the MC-GASSL can efficiently detect all the HUAVs in USNETs with various IFSs and cluster numbers with low detection redundancies.</p></details> |  |

Thus, it is requisite to learn robust representations in graph neural networks. To improve the robustness of graph representation learning, we propose a novel Graph Adversarial Contrastive Learning framework (GraphACL) by introducing adversarial augmentations into graph self-supervised learning. In this framework, we maximize the mutual information between local and global representations of a perturbed graph and its adversarial augmentations, where the adversarial graphs can be generated in either supervised or unsupervised approaches. Based on the Information Bottleneck Principle, we theoretically prove that our method could obtain a much tighter bound, thus improving the robustness of graph representation learning. Empirically, we evaluate several methods on a range of node classification benchmarks and the results demonstrate GraphACL could achieve comparable accuracy over previous supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motif-based Graph Self-Supervised Learning for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00987v2)** | 2021-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting molecular properties with data-driven methods has drawn much attention in recent years. Particularly, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various molecular generation and prediction tasks. In cases where labeled data is scarce, GNNs can be pre-trained on unlabeled molecular data to first learn the general semantic and structural information before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, most existing self-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs only focus on node-level or graph-level tasks. These approaches cannot capture the rich information in subgraphs or graph motifs. For example, functional groups (frequently-occurred subgraphs in molecular graphs) often carry indicative information about the molecular properties. To bridge this gap, we propose Motif-based Graph Self-supervised Learning (MGSSL) by introducing a novel self-supervised motif generation framework for GNNs. First, for motif extraction from molecular graphs, we design a molecule fragmentation method that leverages a retrosynthesis-based algorithm BRICS and additional rules for controlling the size of motif vocabulary. Second, we design a general motif-based generative pre-training framework in which GNNs are asked to make topological and label predictions. This generative framework can be implemented in two different ways, i.e., breadth-first or depth-first. Finally, to take the multi-scale information in molecular graphs into consideration, we introduce a multi-level self-supervised pre-training. Extensive experiments on various downstream benchmark tasks show that our methods outperform all state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS'21</p></details> |

More importantly, unlike other surveys that only provide a high-level description of published research, we present an additional mathematical summary of existing works in a unified framework. Furthermore, to facilitate methodological development and empirical comparisons, we also summarize the commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, downstream tasks, open-source implementations, and experimental study of various algorithms.

However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</p></details> |  |

The main recipe for solving them is the use of Krylov subspace iterative methods with well-designed preconditioners. Recently, GNNs have been shown to be a promising tool for designing preconditioners to reduce the overall computational cost of iterative methods by constructing them more efficiently than with classical linear algebra techniques. Preconditioners designed with these approaches cannot outperform those designed with classical methods in terms of the number of iterations in CG. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN to obtain preconditioners that reduce the condition number of the system more significantly than classical preconditioners. Numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms both classical and neural network-based methods for an important class of parametric partial differential equations. We also provide a heuristic justification for the loss function used and show that preconditioners obtained by learning with this loss function reduce the condition number in a more desirable way for CG.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW25 |

Despite benefiting from high-quality services, users have raised privacy concerns, such as misuse of personal data (e.g., dynamic user-user/item interaction) for model training, requiring DGNNs to ``forget'' their data to meet AI governance laws (e.g., the ``right to be forgotten'' in GDPR). However, current static graph unlearning studies cannot \textit{unlearn dynamic graph elements} and exhibit limitations such as the model-specific design or reliance on pre-processing, which disenable their practicability in dynamic graph unlearning. To this end, we study the dynamic graph unlearning for the first time and propose an effective, efficient, general, and post-processing method to implement DGNN unlearning. Specifically, we first formulate dynamic graph unlearning in the context of continuous-time dynamic graphs, and then propose a method called Gradient Transformation that directly maps the unlearning request to the desired parameter update. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets and state-of-the-art DGNN backbones demonstrate its effectiveness (e.g., limited drop or obvious improvement in utility) and efficiency (e.g., 7.23$\times$ speed-up) advantages. Additionally, our method has the potential to handle future unlearning requests with significant performance gains (e.g., 32.59$\times$ speed-up).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 ACM Web Conference (WWW)</p></details> |

However, the operation of third-party applications in the Near Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC), known as xApps, may result in conflicting interactions. Each xApp can independently modify the same control parameters to achieve distinct outcomes, which has the potential to cause performance degradation and network instability. The current conflict detection and mitigation solutions in the literature assume that all conflicts are known a priori, which does not always hold due to complex and often hidden relationships between control parameters and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In this paper, we introduce the first data-driven method for reconstructing and labeling conflict graphs in O-RAN. Specifically, we leverage GraphSAGE, an inductive learning framework, to dynamically learn the hidden relationships between xApps, parameters, and KPIs. Our numerical results, based on a conflict model used in the O-RAN conflict management literature, demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively reconstruct conflict graphs and identify the conflicts defined by the O-RAN Alliance.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

| **[Discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional MRI via graph neural networks: A systematic review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00577v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainMAP: Learning Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17404v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) is commonly employed to study human brain activity, since it offers insight into the relationship between functional fluctuations and human behavior. To enhance analysis and comprehension of brain activity, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to the analysis of functional connectivities (FC) derived from fMRI data, due to their ability to capture the synergistic interactions among brain regions. However, in the human brain, performing complex tasks typically involves the activation of certain pathways, which could be represented as paths across graphs. As such, conventional GNNs struggle to learn from these pathways due to the long-range dependencies of multiple pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework BrainMAP to learn Multiple Activation Pathways in Brain networks. BrainMAP leverages sequential models to identify long-range correlations among sequentialized brain regions and incorporates an aggregation module based on Mixture of Experts (MoE) to learn from multiple pathways. Our comprehensive experiments highlight BrainMAP's superior performance. Furthermore, our framework enables explanatory analyses of crucial brain regions involved in tasks.

In order to reduce the energy consumption by radio frequency components, each AP selects a subset of antennas for downlink data transmission after estimating the channel state information (CSI). We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

While it is standard to apply graph neural networks or graph kernel methods, Gaussian processes can be employed by transforming spatial features from the graph domain into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, and using them as the input points of classical kernels. However, this approach currently only takes into account features on vertices, whereas some graph datasets also support features on edges. In this work, we present a Gaussian process-based classification algorithm that can leverage one or both vertex and edges features. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition to better capture the intricate richness of vertex and edge features, which can be beneficial on diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Bayesian Decision-Making and Uncertainty (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Following this trend, we propose a novel approach that empowers off-the-shelf LMs to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNNs on node classification tasks, without requiring any architectural modification. By preserving the LM's original architecture, our approach retains a key benefit of LM instruction tuning: the ability to jointly train on diverse datasets, fostering greater flexibility and efficiency. To achieve this, we introduce two key augmentation strategies: (1) Enriching LMs' input using topological and semantic retrieval methods, which provide richer contextual information, and (2) guiding the LMs' classification process through a lightweight GNN classifier that effectively prunes class candidates. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that backbone Flan-T5 LMs equipped with these augmentation strategies outperform SOTA text-output node classifiers and are comparable to top-performing vector-output node classifiers. By bridging the gap between specialized node classifiers and general LMs, this work paves the way for more versatile and widely applicable graph learning models. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. Many novel elements are also incorporated to ensure resolution invariance and temporal continuity. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks, composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen spatial resolutions and time instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19179v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. By propagating local information to distance particles, Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) extend the locality concept to model interactions beyond their local neighborhood. Still, this locality precludes modeling long-range effects, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects, which are critical to adequately describe many real-world systems. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenging modeling of non-local interactions and the high computational cost of MPNNs. This novel architecture generalizes the fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network (4GHDNN) concept, integrating the charge equilibration (Qeq) method into a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. A series of benchmarks show that CELLI can extend the strictly local Allegro architecture to model highly non-local interactions and charge transfer. Our architecture generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures, achieving an accuracy comparable to MPNNs at about twice the computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Oversmoothing in GNNs as Consensus in Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19089v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to classes of neural networks where the learned representations become increasingly expressive with network depth, the learned representations in graph neural networks (GNNs), tend to become increasingly similar. This phenomena, known as oversmoothing, is characterized by learned representations that cannot be reliably differentiated leading to reduced predictive performance. In this paper, we propose an analogy between oversmoothing in GNNs and consensus or agreement in opinion dynamics. Through this analogy, we show that the message passing structure of recent continuous-depth GNNs is equivalent to a special case of opinion dynamics (i.e., linear consensus models) which has been theoretically proven to converge to consensus (i.e., oversmoothing) for all inputs. Using the understanding developed through this analogy, we design a new continuous-depth GNN model based on nonlinear opinion dynamics and prove that our model, which we call behavior-inspired message passing neural network (BIMP) circumvents oversmoothing for general inputs. Through extensive experiments, we show that BIMP is robust to oversmoothing and adversarial attack, and consistently outperforms competitive baselines on numerous benchmarks.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |

In this report, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to tackle the Job Allocation Problem (JAP). The JAP involves allocating a maximum set of jobs to available resources while considering several constraints. Our approach enables learning of adaptive policies through trial-and-error interactions with the environment while exploiting the graph-structured data of the problem. By leveraging RL, we eliminate the need for manual annotation, a major bottleneck in supervised learning approaches. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach, outperforming baseline algorithms and showcasing its potential for optimizing job allocation in complex scheduling problems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Graph Pattern Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18739v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning tasks require models to comprehend essential substructure patterns relevant to downstream tasks, such as triadic closures in social networks and benzene rings in molecular graphs. Due to the non-Euclidean nature of graphs, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing to iteratively aggregate information from local neighborhoods. Despite their empirical success, message passing struggles to identify fundamental substructures, such as triangles, limiting its expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a framework designed to learn directly from graph patterns. GPM efficiently extracts and encodes substructures while identifying the most relevant ones for downstream tasks. We also demonstrate that GPM offers superior expressivity and improved long-range information modeling compared to message passing. Empirical evaluations on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and regression show the superiority of GPM over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals its desirable out-of-distribution robustness, scalability, and interpretability. We consider GPM to be a step toward going beyond message passing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> |  |

Molecular graphs have become a focus for representation learning, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) widely used. However, GNNs often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose MolGraph-xLSTM, a novel graph-based xLSTM model that enhances feature extraction and effectively models molecule long-range interactions. Our approach processes molecular graphs at two scales: atom-level and motif-level. For atom-level graphs, a GNN-based xLSTM framework with jumping knowledge extracts local features and aggregates multilayer information to capture both local and global patterns effectively. Motif-level graphs provide complementary structural information for a broader molecular view. Embeddings from both scales are refined via a multi-head mixture of experts (MHMoE), further enhancing expressiveness and performance. We validate MolGraph-xLSTM on 10 molecular property prediction datasets, covering both classification and regression tasks. Our model demonstrates consistent performance across all datasets, with improvements of up to 7.03% on the BBBP dataset for classification and 7.54% on the ESOL dataset for regression compared to baselines. On average, MolGraph-xLSTM achieves an AUROC improvement of 3.18\% for classification tasks and an RMSE reduction of 3.83\% across regression datasets compared to the baseline methods. These results confirm the effectiveness of our model, offering a promising solution for molecular representation learning for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet</p></details> |  |

However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other. Experimental results across six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that ComGRL achieves excellent performance in node classification tasks. The code could be available at https://github.com/JinluWang1002/ComGRL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

To efficiently encode DGs for downstream tasks, most dynamic graph neural networks follow the traditional message-passing mechanism and extend it with time-based techniques. Despite their effectiveness, the growth of historical interactions introduces significant scalability issues, particularly in industry scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose ScaDyG, with the core idea of designing a time-aware scalable learning paradigm as follows: 1) Time-aware Topology Reformulation: ScaDyG first segments historical interactions into time steps (intra and inter) based on dynamic modeling, enabling weight-free and time-aware graph propagation within pre-processing. 2) Dynamic Temporal Encoding: To further achieve fine-grained graph propagation within time steps, ScaDyG integrates temporal encoding through a combination of exponential functions in a scalable manner. 3) Hypernetwork-driven Message Aggregation: After obtaining the propagated features (i.e., messages), ScaDyG utilizes hypernetwork to analyze historical dependencies, implementing node-wise representation by an adaptive temporal fusion. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that ScaDyG performs comparably well or even outperforms other SOTA methods in both node and link-level downstream tasks, with fewer learnable parameters and higher efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing PTQ strategies underperform at low bit levels < 3 bits due to the significant difference between the quantized and original weights. To enhance the quantization performance at low bit widths, we introduce a Mixed-precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) approach, employing a graph neural network (GNN) module to capture dependencies among weights and adaptively assign quantization bit-widths. Through the information propagation of the GNN module, our method more effectively captures dependencies among target weights, leading to a more accurate assessment of weight importance and optimized allocation of quantization strategies. Extensive experiments on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets demonstrate that our MG-PTQ method outperforms previous state-of-the-art PTQ method GPTQ, setting new benchmarks for quantization performance under low-bit conditions.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |

In this paper, we propose ACTGNN, a graph-based framework designed to assess clustering tendency by leveraging graph representations of data. Node features are constructed using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which captures local neighborhood information, while edge features incorporate multiple similarity metrics, such as the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, to model pairwise relationships. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is trained exclusively on synthetic datasets, enabling robust learning of clustering structures under controlled conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACTGNN significantly outperforms baseline methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, exhibiting superior performance in detecting faint clustering structures, even in high-dimensional or noisy data. Our results highlight the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, making it a promising tool for robust clustering tendency assessment.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v4: updated authors</p></details> |

Despite the evolution of augmentation methods, issues like graph property distortions and restricted structural changes persist. This leads to the question: Is it possible to develop more property-conserving and structure-sensitive augmentation methods? Through a spectral lens, we investigate the interplay between graph properties, their augmentation, and their spectral behavior, and observe that keeping the low-frequency eigenvalues unchanged can preserve the critical properties at a large scale when generating augmented graphs. These observations inform our introduction of the Dual-Prism (DP) augmentation methods, including DP-Noise and DP-Mask, which retain essential graph properties while diversifying augmented graphs. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of our approach, providing a new and promising direction for graph data augmentation.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'25 |

Many generative models aim to accelerate drug discovery, but few produce synthetically accessible molecules. Conversely, synthesis-focused models do not leverage the 3D information crucial for effective drug design. We introduce SynthFormer, a novel machine learning model that generates fully synthesizable molecules, structured as synthetic trees, by introducing both 3D information and pharmacophores as input. SynthFormer features a 3D equivariant graph neural network to encode pharmacophores, followed by a Transformer-based synthesis-aware decoding mechanism for constructing synthetic trees as a sequence of tokens. It is a first-of-its-kind approach that could provide capabilities for designing active molecules based on pharmacophores, exploring the local synthesizable chemical space around hit molecules and optimizing their properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various challenging tasks, including designing active compounds for a range of proteins, performing hit expansion and optimizing molecular properties.</p></details> |  |

However, their focus on pairwise interactions limits their ability to process the higher-order relations essential for identifying distinct audio objects. To address this limitation, this work introduces the Local- Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), a graph based model that enhances feature understanding by integrating local neighbourhood information with higher-order data from Fuzzy C-Means clusters, thereby capturing a broader spectrum of audio relationships. Evaluation of the model on three publicly available audio datasets shows that it outperforms Transformer-based models across all benchmarks while operating with substantially fewer parameters.

Despite their prevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial stationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial process heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several approaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural networks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective on graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction accuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large number of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process heterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which largely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop a heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in the process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph convolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of county-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on socioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant improvement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an exploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships through ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work contributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in tackling spatial heterogeneity.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures |

While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex textual-attributed graph data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |

On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the thoracic aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel method that integrates both approaches for enhanced performance. Our framework uses Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based and sequential recommenders as separate submodules while sharing a unified embedding space optimized jointly. To enable positive knowledge transfer, we design a loss function that enforces alignment and uniformity both within and across submodules. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms using either approach alone and achieves state-of-the-art results.

| **[Reqo: A Robust and Explainable Query Optimization Cost Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17414v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning (ML) in query optimization to select more efficient plans. Existing learning-based query optimizers use certain model architectures to convert tree-structured query plans into representations suitable for downstream ML tasks. As the design of these architectures significantly impacts cost estimation, we propose a tree model architecture based on Bidirectional Graph Neural Networks (Bi-GNN) aggregated by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to achieve more accurate cost estimates. The inherent uncertainty of data and model parameters also leads to inaccurate cost estimates, resulting in suboptimal plans and less robust query performance. To address this, we implement a novel learning-to-rank cost model that effectively quantifies the uncertainty in cost estimates using approximate probabilistic ML. This model adaptively integrates quantified uncertainty with estimated costs and learns from comparing pairwise plans, achieving more robust performance. In addition, we propose the first explainability technique specifically designed for learning-based cost models. This technique explains the contribution of any subgraphs in the query plan to the final predicted cost, which can be integrated and trained with any learning-based cost model to significantly boost the model's explainability. By incorporating these innovations, we propose a cost model for a Robust and Explainable Query Optimizer, Reqo, that improves the accuracy, robustness, and explainability of cost estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in all three dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Geometric Perspective for High-Dimensional Multiplex Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17374v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional multiplex graphs are characterized by their high number of complementary and divergent dimensions. The existence of multiple hierarchical latent relations between the graph dimensions poses significant challenges to embedding methods. In particular, the geometric distortions that might occur in the representational space have been overlooked in the literature. This work studies the problem of high-dimensional multiplex graph embedding from a geometric perspective. We find that the node representations reside on highly curved manifolds, thus rendering their exploitation more challenging for downstream tasks. Moreover, our study reveals that increasing the number of graph dimensions can cause further distortions to the highly curved manifolds. To address this problem, we propose a novel multiplex graph embedding method that harnesses hierarchical dimension embedding and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks. The proposed approach hierarchically extracts hyperbolic node representations that reside on Riemannian manifolds while gradually learning fewer and more expressive latent dimensions of the multiplex graph. Experimental results on real-world high-dimensional multiplex graphs show that the synergy between hierarchical and hyperbolic embeddings incurs much fewer geometric distortions and brings notable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024, DOI: 10.1145/3627673.3679541</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Models for Estimating Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17714v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems can be represented as sets of interacting components. Examples of such systems include computational systems such as query processors, natural systems such as cells, and social systems such as families. Many approaches have been proposed in traditional (associational) machine learning to model such structured systems, including statistical relational models and graph neural networks. Despite this prior work, existing approaches to estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is represented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This approach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each component and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the unit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional approach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate counterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved overlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the classical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of novel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Most of the state-of-the-art models that leverage these techniques require labeled examples, hard to obtain in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, unsupervised learning and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have emerged as interesting approaches to reduce the dependency on labeled data. Nonetheless, these methods tend to yield more anomalous detection algorithms rather than effective attack detection systems. This paper introduces Few Edges Are Enough (FEAE), a GNN-based architecture trained with SSL and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to better distinguish between false positive anomalies and actual attacks. To maximize the potential of few-shot examples, our model employs a hybrid self-supervised objective that combines the advantages of contrastive-based and reconstruction-based SSL. By leveraging only a minimal number of labeled attack events, represented as attack edges, FEAE achieves competitive performance on two well-known network datasets compared to both supervised and unsupervised methods. Remarkably, our experimental results unveil that employing only 1 malicious event for each attack type in the dataset is sufficient to achieve substantial improvements. FEAE not only outperforms self-supervised GNN baselines but also surpasses some supervised approaches on one of the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the author, accepted for publication at IWSEC 2024.

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the Shapley Value (SV) is the predominant method to quantify contributions of individual features to a ML model's output. Addressing the limitations of SVs in complex prediction models, Shapley Interactions (SIs) extend the SV to groups of features. In this work, we explain single graph predictions of GNNs with SIs that quantify node contributions and interactions among multiple nodes. By exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in node embeddings are preserved for graph prediction. As a result, the exponential complexity of SIs depends only on the receptive fields, i.e. the message-passing ranges determined by the connectivity of the graph and the number of convolutional layers. Based on our theoretical results, we introduce GraphSHAP-IQ, an efficient approach to compute any-order SIs exactly. GraphSHAP-IQ is applicable to popular message passing techniques in conjunction with a linear global pooling and output layer. We showcase that GraphSHAP-IQ substantially reduces the exponential complexity of computing exact SIs on multiple benchmark datasets. Beyond exact computation, we evaluate GraphSHAP-IQ's approximation of SIs on popular GNN architectures and compare with existing baselines. Lastly, we visualize SIs of real-world water distribution networks and molecule structures using a SI-Graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version.

| **[Dynamic Hypergraph Representation for Bone Metastasis Cancer Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16787v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bone metastasis analysis is a significant challenge in pathology and plays a critical role in determining patient quality of life and treatment strategies. The microenvironment and specific tissue structures are essential for pathologists to predict the primary bone cancer origins and primary bone cancer subtyping. By digitizing bone tissue sections into whole slide images (WSIs) and leveraging deep learning to model slide embeddings, this analysis can be enhanced. However, tumor metastasis involves complex multivariate interactions with diverse bone tissue structures, which traditional WSI analysis methods such as multiple instance learning (MIL) fail to capture. Moreover, graph neural networks (GNNs), limited to modeling pairwise relationships, are hard to represent high-order biological associations. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic hypergraph neural network (DyHG) that overcomes the edge construction limitations of traditional graph representations by connecting multiple nodes via hyperedges. A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the complexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a Gumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across hyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding for comprehensive WSI analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of DyHG, we construct two large-scale datasets for primary bone cancer origins and subtyping classification based on real-world bone metastasis scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyHG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showcasing its ability to model complex biological interactions and improve the accuracy of bone metastasis analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages,11 figures |
| **[Hypergraph Diffusion for High-Order Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16722v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems rely on Collaborative Filtering (CF) to predict user preferences by leveraging patterns in historical user-item interactions. While traditional CF methods primarily focus on learning compact vector embeddings for users and items, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative, utilizing the structure of user-item interaction graphs to enhance recommendation accuracy. However, existing GNN-based models, such as LightGCN and UltraGCN, often struggle with two major limitations: an inability to fully account for heterophilic interactions, where users engage with diverse item categories, and the over-smoothing problem in multi-layer GNNs, which hinders their ability to model complex, high-order relationships. To address these gaps, we introduce WaveHDNN, an innovative wavelet-enhanced hypergraph diffusion framework. WaveHDNN integrates a Heterophily-aware Collaborative Encoder, designed to capture user-item interactions across diverse categories, with a Multi-scale Group-wise Structure Encoder, which leverages wavelet transforms to effectively model localized graph structures. Additionally, cross-view contrastive learning is employed to maintain robust and consistent representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of WaveHDNN, demonstrating its superior ability to capture both heterophilic and localized structural information, leading to improved recommendation performance.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are essential in many DMTN problems due to their capability to represent spatial correlations between entities.

Along these directions, we discuss new research opportunities based on the significance of transportation problems and data availability. Finally, we compile resources such as data, code, and other learning materials to foster interdisciplinary communication. This review, driven by recent trends in GNNs in DMTN studies since 2023, could democratize abundant datasets and efficient GNN methods for various transportation problems including prediction and operation.</p></details> | 41 pages, 6 figures |

The WPF problem remains unresolved due to numerous influencing variables, such as wind speed, temperature, latitude, and longitude. Furthermore, achieving high prediction accuracy is crucial for maintaining electric grid stability and ensuring supply security. In this paper, we model all wind turbines within a wind farm as graph nodes in a graph built by their geographical locations. Accordingly, we propose an ensemble model based on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning (EMGRL) for WPF. Our approach includes: (1) applying graph neural networks to capture the time-series data from neighboring wind farms relevant to the target wind farm; (2) establishing a general state embedding that integrates the target wind farm's data with the historical performance of base models on the target wind farm; (3) ensembling and leveraging the advantages of all base models through an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework for WPF.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a distributed framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL) methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

However, the vast bandwidths available also make the impact of beam squint in massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems non-negligible. Traditional approaches such as adding a true-time-delay line (TTD) on each antenna are costly due to the massive antenna arrays required. This paper puts forth a signal processing alternative, specifically adapted to the multicarrier structure of OFDM systems, through an innovative application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize hybrid beamforming. By integrating two types of graph nodes to represent the analog and the digital beamforming matrices efficiently, our approach not only reduces the computational and memory burdens but also achieves high spectral efficiency performance, approaching that of all digital beamforming. The GNN runtime and memory requirement are at a fraction of the processing time and resource consumption of traditional signal processing methods, hence enabling real-time adaptation of hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, the proposed GNN exhibits strong resiliency to beam squinting, achieving almost constant spectral efficiency even as the system bandwidth increases at higher carrier frequencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

Recently, the principal odor map (POM) was introduced to digitize the olfactory properties of single compounds. However, smells in real life are not pure single molecules, but complex mixtures of molecules, whose representations remain relatively under-explored. In this work, we introduce POMMix, an extension of the POM to represent mixtures. Our representation builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across multiple datasets. We also evaluate the generalizability of the representation on multiple splits when applied to unseen molecules and mixture sizes. Our work advances the effort to digitize olfaction, and highlights the synergy of domain expertise and deep learning in crafting expressive representations in low-data regimes.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

Recently, incorporating graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture additional syntactic structure information in the dependency tree derived from syntactic dependency parsing has been proven to be an effective paradigm for boosting ABSA. Despite GNNs enhancing model capability by fusing more types of information, most works only utilize a single topology view of the dependency tree or simply conflate different perspectives of information without distinction, which limits the model performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new multi-view attention syntactic enhanced graph convolutional network (MASGCN) that weighs different syntactic information of views using attention mechanisms. Specifically, we first construct distance mask matrices from the dependency tree to obtain multiple subgraph views for GNNs. To aggregate features from different views, we propose a multi-view attention mechanism to calculate the attention weights of views. Furthermore, to incorporate more syntactic information, we fuse the dependency type information matrix into the adjacency matrices and present a structural entropy loss to learn the dependency type adjacency matrix. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an innovative solution. GC focuses on synthesizing a compact yet highly representative graph, enabling GNNs trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large graph. The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into five categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, fairness, and robustness. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, this paper examines various methods under each category and thoroughly discusses two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. We also empirically compare and analyze representative GC methods with diverse optimization strategies based on the five proposed GC evaluation criteria.

They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These challenges stem from the ever-changing infrastructure, which is characterized by additions, removals, and reconfigurations of nodes and links, as well as the variability of application workloads. Traditional centralized approaches struggle to adapt to these changes due to their static nature, while decentralized solutions face challenges such as limited global visibility and coordination overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid decentralized framework for dynamic application placement and resource management. The framework utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to embed resource and application states, enabling comprehensive representation and efficient decision-making. It employs a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, where local agents optimize resource management in their neighborhoods and a global orchestrator ensures system-wide coordination. By combining decentralized application placement with centralized oversight, our framework addresses the scalability, adaptability, and accuracy challenges inherent in the Cloud-Edge Continuum. This work contributes to the development of decentralized application placement strategies, the integration of GNN embeddings, and collaborative MARL systems, providing a foundation for efficient, adaptive and scalable resource management.</p></details> |  |

While research has largely focused on developing specialized graph LLMs through task-specific instruction tuning, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs solely through prompt design remains surprisingly absent. Without such a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, tailored graph LLMs are compared against general LLMs using simplistic queries (e.g., zero-shot reasoning with LLaMA), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well as unexpected predicaments of them. To achieve more general evaluations and unveil the true potential of LLMs for graph tasks, we introduce Graph In-context Learning (GraphICL) Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark comprising novel prompt templates designed to capture graph structure and handle limited label knowledge. Our systematic evaluation shows that general-purpose LLMs equipped with our GraphICL outperform state-of-the-art specialized graph LLMs and graph neural network models in resource-constrained settings and out-of-domain tasks. These findings highlight the significant potential of prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on graph learning tasks without training and offer a strong baseline for advancing research in graph LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures; vehicle grouping method updated, explainable GNN framework incorporated</p></details> |

Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In particular, de Santi et al. (2023) developed models that could accurately infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to uncertainties in astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including 1) masking, 2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and 3) different galaxy selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, intertwining galaxies' radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that, although the presence of these effects degrades the precision and accuracy of the models, and increases the fraction of catalogs where the model breaks down, the fraction of galaxy catalogs where the model performs well is over 90 %, demonstrating the potential of these models to constrain cosmological parameters even when applied to real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Distributionally Robust Graph Out-of-Distribution Recommendation via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15555v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |
| **[Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |
| **[Mamba-Based Graph Convolutional Networks: Tackling Over-smoothing with Selective State Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15461v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in various graph-based learning tasks. However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[An Aspect Performance-aware Hypergraph Neural Network for Review-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15429v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online reviews allow consumers to provide detailed feedback on various aspects of items. Existing methods utilize these aspects to model users' fine-grained preferences for specific item features through graph neural networks. We argue that the performance of items on different aspects is important for making precise recommendations, which has not been taken into account by existing approaches, due to lack of data. In this paper, we propose an aspect performance-aware hypergraph neural network (APH) for the review-based recommendation, which learns the performance of items from the conflicting sentiment polarity of user reviews. Specifically, APH comprehensively models the relationships among users, items, aspects, and sentiment polarity by systematically constructing an aspect hypergraph based on user reviews. In addition, APH aggregates aspects representing users and items by employing an aspect performance-aware hypergraph aggregation method. It aggregates the sentiment polarities from multiple users by jointly considering user preferences and the semantics of their sentiments, determining the weights of sentiment polarities to infer the performance of items on various aspects. Such performances are then used as weights to aggregate neighboring aspects. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that APH improves MSE, Precision@5, and Recall@5 by an average of 2.30%, 4.89%, and 1.60% over the best baseline.

Existing fair graph learning typically favors pairwise constraints to achieve fairness but fails to cast off dimensional limitations and generalize them into multiple sensitive attributes; besides, most studies focus on in-processing techniques to enforce and calibrate fairness, constructing a model-agnostic debiasing GNN framework at the pre-processing stage to prevent downstream misuses and improve training reliability is still largely under-explored. Furthermore, previous work on GNNs tend to enhance either fairness or privacy individually but few probe into their interplays. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic debiasing framework named MAPPING (\underline{M}asking \underline{A}nd \underline{P}runing and Message-\underline{P}assing train\underline{ING}) for fair node classification, in which we adopt the distance covariance($dCov$)-based fairness constraints to simultaneously reduce feature and topology biases in arbitrary dimensions, and combine them with adversarial debiasing to confine the risks of attribute inference attacks. Experiments on real-world datasets with different GNN variants demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MAPPING. Our results show that MAPPING can achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness, and mitigate privacy risks of sensitive information leakage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW Journal.

| **[ReInc: Scaling Training of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15348v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their applicability in diverse domains such as traffic network prediction, epidemiological forecasting, and social network analysis. In this paper, we present ReInc, a system designed to enable efficient and scalable training of DGNNs on large-scale graphs. ReInc introduces key innovations that capitalize on the unique combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) inherent in DGNNs. By reusing intermediate results and incrementally computing aggregations across consecutive graph snapshots, ReInc significantly enhances computational efficiency. To support these optimizations, ReInc incorporates a novel two-level caching mechanism with a specialized caching policy aligned to the DGNN execution workflow. Additionally, ReInc addresses the challenges of managing structural and temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs through a new distributed training strategy. This approach eliminates communication overheads associated with accessing remote features and redistributing intermediate results. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInc achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, tested across various dynamic GNN architectures and real-world graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of these future interactions can enhance adaptive monitoring, enabling proactive maintenance and resolution of potential performance issues before they escalate. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network GNN based approach, specifically using a Graph Attention Network GAT, for link prediction in microservice Call Graphs. Unlike social networks, where interactions tend to occur sporadically and are often less frequent, microservice Call Graphs involve highly frequent and time sensitive interactions that are essential to operational performance. Our approach leverages temporal segmentation, advanced negative sampling, and GATs attention mechanisms to model these complex interactions accurately. Using real world data, we evaluate our model across performance metrics such as AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness in predicting microservice interactions. Our findings support the potential of GNNs for proactive monitoring in distributed systems, paving the way for applications in adaptive resource management and performance optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation and publication at the ICPE 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Layer Selection for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14964v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and personalized graph representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[FIT-GNN: Faster Inference Time for GNNs Using Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15001v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. To tackle this, coarsening-based methods are used to reduce the graph into a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during both training and inference phases. We demonstrate two different methods (Extra-Nodes and Cluster-Nodes). Our study also proposes a unique application of the coarsening algorithm for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression, which have not yet been explored. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets in the order of $100K$ nodes to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in tasks involving classification and regression on nodes and graphs, compared to traditional GNNs, while having single-node inference times that are orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces memory consumption, allowing training and inference on low-resource devices where traditional methods struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this article, we take this field further by introducing novel architectural modifications compatible with a wide array of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. Our approach advocates for integrating capsule layers, replacing the conventional decoding blocks in standard GNNs. These capsules are a group of neurons with vector activations. The orientation of these vectors represents important properties of the objects under study, with their magnitude characterizing whether the object under study belongs to the class represented by the capsule. Moreover, capsule networks incorporate a regularization by reconstruction mechanism, facilitating the seamless integration of expert-designed high-level features into the analysis. We have studied the usefulness of our architecture with the LorentzNet architecture for quark-gluon tagging. Here, we have replaced the decoding block of LorentzNet with a capsulated decoding block and have called the resulting architecture CapsLorentzNet. Our new architecture can enhance the performance of LorentzNet by 20 \% for the quark-gluon tagging task.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[On the Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio, a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-Type Homophily-guided Heterogeneous Graph Pruning, a method designed to selectively remove low-homophily crosstype edges, thereby enhancing the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio and boosting the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). Extensive experiments on five real-world HG datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which delivers up to 13.36% average relative performance improvement for HGNNs, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12231v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph containing over 100 million nodes with flexible reduction rates and improves performance on the second-largest Ogbn-products dataset by over 5%. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework.

Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN), a key branch of FedGNN, handles scenarios where data features and labels are distributed among participants. Despite the robust privacy-preserving design of VFGNN, we have found that it still faces the risk of backdoor attacks, even in situations where labels are inaccessible. This paper proposes BVG, a novel backdoor attack method that leverages multi-hop triggers and backdoor retention, requiring only four target-class nodes to execute effective attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that BVG achieves nearly 100% attack success rates across three commonly used datasets and three GNN models, with minimal impact on the main task accuracy. We also evaluated various defense methods, and the BVG method maintained high attack effectiveness even under existing defenses. This finding highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process. To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM The Web Conference 2025, WWW 2025</p></details> |

However, the theoretical foundations underlying their empirical performance are not well understood. In this article, we examine the convergence of gradient dynamics in the training of linear GNNs. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the gradient flow that minimizes the total weights at the global minimum. In addition to the gradient flow, we study the convergence of linear GNNs under gradient descent training, an iterative scheme viewed as a discretization of gradient flow.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14246v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that human emotions are closely linked to specific brain regions, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets (SEED, SEED-IV and MPED) demonstrate that the proposed method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Top Ten Challenges Towards Agentic Neural Graph Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14224v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph databases (GDBs) like Neo4j and TigerGraph excel at handling interconnected data but lack advanced inference capabilities. Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.</p></details> | 12 Pages |
| **[Motif-aware Attribute Masking for Molecular Graph Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04589v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extractive Schema Linking for Text-to-SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17174v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL is emerging as a practical interface for real world databases. The dominant paradigm for Text-to-SQL is cross-database or schema-independent, supporting application schemas unseen during training. The schema of a database defines the tables, columns, column types and foreign key connections between tables. Real world schemas can be large, containing hundreds of columns, but for any particular query only a small fraction will be relevant. Placing the entire schema in the prompt for an LLM can be impossible for models with smaller token windows and expensive even when the context window is large enough to allow it. Even apart from computational considerations, the accuracy of the model can be improved by focusing the SQL generation on only the relevant portion of the database. Schema linking identifies the portion of the database schema useful for the question. Previous work on schema linking has used graph neural networks, generative LLMs, and cross encoder classifiers. We introduce a new approach to adapt decoder-only LLMs to schema linking that is both computationally more efficient and more accurate than the generative approach. Additionally our extractive approach permits fine-grained control over the precision-recall trade-off for schema linking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossfire: An Elastic Defense Framework for Graph Neural Networks Under Bit Flip Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13776v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs) are a well-established class of adversarial attacks, originally developed for Convolutional Neural Networks within the computer vision domain. Most recently, these attacks have been extended to target Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), revealing significant vulnerabilities. This new development naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs against BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the applications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only maintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its pre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also eliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network quality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot- and hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain to GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome their limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight sparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of out-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is retraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160 experiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher probability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to its pre-attack state. These experiments cover up to 55 bit flips from various attacks. Moreover, it improves post-repair prediction quality by 10.85%. Computational and storage overheads are negligible compared to the inherent complexity of even the simplest GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025, DOI will be included after publication</p></details> |
| **[Sample complexity of data-driven tuning of model hyperparameters in neural networks with structured parameter-dependent dual function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13734v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Road to Learning Explainable Inverse Kinematic Models: Graph Neural Networks as Inductive Bias for Symbolic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13641v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper shows how a Graph Neural Network (GNN) can be used to learn an Inverse Kinematics (IK) based on an automatically generated dataset. The generated Inverse Kinematics is generalized to a family of manipulators with the same Degree of Freedom (DOF), but varying link length configurations. The results indicate a position error of less than 1.0 cm for 3 DOF and 4.5 cm for 5 DOF, and orientation error of 2$^\circ$ for 3 DOF and 8.2$^\circ$ for 6 DOF, which allows the deployment to certain real world-problems. However, out-of-domain errors and lack of extrapolation can be observed in the resulting GNN. An extensive analysis of these errors indicates potential for enhancement in the future. Consequently, the generated GNNs are tailored to be used in future work as an inductive bias to generate analytical equations through symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGrAINS: Personalized SubGraph Federated Learning with Adaptive Neighbor Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12592v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are crucial for modeling relational and biological data. As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SDM2025 (SIAM Data Mining 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VARFVV: View-Adaptive Real-Time Interactive Free-View Video Streaming with Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13630v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-view video (FVV) allows users to explore immersive video content from multiple views. However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/qianghu-huber/VARFVV.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13493v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[RIDA: A Robust Attack Framework on Incomplete Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18170v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vital in data science but are increasingly susceptible to adversarial attacks. To help researchers develop more robust GNN models, it's essential to focus on designing strong attack models as foundational benchmarks and guiding references. Among adversarial attacks, gray-box poisoning attacks are noteworthy due to their effectiveness and fewer constraints. These attacks exploit GNNs' need for retraining on updated data, thereby impacting their performance by perturbing these datasets. However, current research overlooks the real-world scenario of incomplete graphs.To address this gap, we introduce the Robust Incomplete Deep Attack Framework (RIDA). It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs. The approach innovatively aggregates distant vertex information and ensures powerful data utilization.Extensive tests against 9 SOTA baselines on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate RIDA's superiority in handling incompleteness and high attack performance on the incomplete graph.</p></details> |  |
