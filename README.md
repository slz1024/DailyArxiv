| **[Position: Graph Learning Will Lose Relevance Due To Poor Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14546v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While machine learning on graphs has demonstrated promise in drug design and molecular property prediction, significant benchmarking challenges hinder its further progress and relevance. Current benchmarking practices often lack focus on transformative, real-world applications, favoring narrow domains like two-dimensional molecular graphs over broader, impactful areas such as combinatorial optimization, relational databases, or chip design. Additionally, many benchmark datasets poorly represent the underlying data, leading to inadequate abstractions and misaligned use cases. Fragmented evaluations and an excessive focus on accuracy further exacerbate these issues, incentivizing overfitting rather than fostering generalizable insights. These limitations have prevented the development of truly useful graph foundation models. This position paper calls for a paradigm shift toward more meaningful benchmarks, rigorous evaluation protocols, and stronger collaboration with domain experts to drive impactful and reliable advances in graph learning research, unlocking the potential of graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13339v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) are at the frontier for deep learning on knowledge graphs (KGs), as they can generalize to completely novel knowledge graphs with different relational vocabularies. Despite their empirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs. Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that the use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of datasets drawn from different domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Foundation Models for Recommendation: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08346v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) serve as a fundamental tool for navigating the vast expanse of online information, with deep learning advancements playing an increasingly important role in improving ranking accuracy. Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiNT: Multi-Network Training for Transfer Learning on Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10426v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Learning (TGL) has become a robust framework for discovering patterns in dynamic networks and predicting future interactions. While existing research has largely concentrated on learning from individual networks, this study explores the potential of learning from multiple temporal networks and its ability to transfer to unobserved networks. To achieve this, we introduce Temporal Multi-network Training MiNT, a novel pre-training approach that learns from multiple temporal networks. With a novel collection of 84 temporal transaction networks, we pre-train TGL models on up to 64 networks and assess their transferability to 20 unseen networks. Remarkably, MiNT achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot inference, surpassing models individually trained on each network. Our findings further demonstrate that increasing the number of pre-training networks significantly improves transfer performance. This work lays the groundwork for developing Temporal Graph Foundation Models, highlighting the significant potential of multi-network pre-training in TGL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[SAMGPT: Text-free Graph Foundation Model for Multi-domain Pre-training and Cross-domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05424v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are able to model interconnected entities in many online services, supporting a wide range of applications on the Web. This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00529v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks: next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-, edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[RiemannGFM: Learning a Graph Foundation Model from Riemannian Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03251v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, pretraining a single model to offer cross-domain transferability on different datasets. Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW25 |
| **[Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoGraph, a novel autoregressive framework for generating large attributed graphs using decoder-only transformers. At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Analysis on LLM-based Node Classification Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00829v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes ten datasets, eight LLM-based algorithms, and three learning paradigms, and is designed for easy extension with new methods and datasets. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,200 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size) that affect performance. Our findings uncover eight insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field.

| **[UniGraph2: Learning a Unified Embedding Space to Bind Multimodal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00806v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing foundation models, such as CLIP, aim to learn a unified embedding space for multimodal data, enabling a wide range of downstream web-based applications like search, recommendation, and content classification. However, these models often overlook the inherent graph structures in multimodal datasets, where entities and their relationships are crucial. Multimodal graphs (MMGs) represent such graphs where each node is associated with features from different modalities, while the edges capture the relationships between these entities. On the other hand, existing graph foundation models primarily focus on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and are not designed to handle the complexities of MMGs. To address these limitations, we propose UniGraph2, a novel cross-domain graph foundation model that enables general representation learning on MMGs, providing a unified embedding space. UniGraph2 employs modality-specific encoders alongside a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a unified low-dimensional embedding space that captures both the multimodal information and the underlying graph structure. We propose a new cross-domain multi-graph pre-training algorithm at scale to ensure effective transfer learning across diverse graph domains and modalities. Additionally, we adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) component to align features from different domains and modalities, ensuring coherent and robust embeddings that unify the information across modalities. Extensive experiments on a variety of multimodal graph tasks demonstrate that UniGraph2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in tasks such as representation learning, transfer learning, and multimodal generative tasks, offering a scalable and flexible solution for learning on MMGs.</p></details> | WWW 2025 |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models on Graphs: An Analysis on Cross-Dataset Transfer of Pretrained GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17609v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To develop a preliminary understanding towards Graph Foundation Models, we study the extent to which pretrained Graph Neural Networks can be applied across datasets, an effort requiring to be agnostic to dataset-specific features and their encodings. We build upon a purely structural pretraining approach and propose an extension to capture feature information while still being feature-agnostic. We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data. Feature information can lead to improvements, but currently requires some similarities between pretraining and downstream feature spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the NeurIPS 2024 workshop "Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations" (NeuReps 2024)</p></details> |
| **[IOHunter: Graph Foundation Model to Uncover Online Information Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14663v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms have become vital spaces for public discourse, serving as modern agor\'as where a wide range of voices influence societal narratives. However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[GraphMoRE: Mitigating Topological Heterogeneity via Mixture of Riemannian Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11085v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs have inherently complex and diverse topological patterns, known as topological heterogeneity. Most existing works learn graph representation in a single constant curvature space that is insufficient to match the complex geometric shapes, resulting in low-quality embeddings with high distortion. This also constitutes a critical challenge for graph foundation models, which are expected to uniformly handle a wide variety of diverse graph data. Recent studies have indicated that product manifold gains the possibility to address topological heterogeneity. However, the product manifold is still homogeneous, which is inadequate and inflexible for representing the mixed heterogeneous topology. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Mixture of Riemannian Experts (GraphMoRE) framework to effectively tackle topological heterogeneity by personalized fine-grained topology geometry pattern preservation. Specifically, to minimize the embedding distortion, we propose a topology-aware gating mechanism to select the optimal embedding space for each node. By fusing the outputs of diverse Riemannian experts with learned gating weights, we construct personalized mixed curvature spaces for nodes, effectively embedding the graph into a heterogeneous manifold with varying curvatures at different points. Furthermore, to fairly measure pairwise distances between different embedding spaces, we present a concise and effective alignment strategy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with lower distortion, highlighting its potential for modeling complex graphs with topological heterogeneity, and providing a novel architectural perspective for graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Main Technical Track of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Study on the Generalization of Positional and Structural Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07407v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in integrating positional and structural encodings (PSEs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced their performance across various graph learning tasks. However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Topology Only Pre-Training: Towards Generalised Multi-Domain Graph Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03976v4)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The principal benefit of unsupervised representation learning is that a pre-trained model can be fine-tuned where data or labels are scarce. Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

| **[GFT: Graph Foundation Model with Transferable Tree Vocabulary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06070v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of foundation models in applications such as ChatGPT, as graph data has been ubiquitous, one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) with broader applications in the areas such as scientific research, social network analysis, drug discovery, and e-commerce. Despite the significant progress of pre-trained graph neural networks, there haven't been GFMs that can achieve desired performance on various graph-learning-related tasks. Building GFMs may rely on a vocabulary that encodes transferable patterns shared among different tasks and domains. Unlike image and text, defining such transferable patterns for graphs remains an open question. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by rethinking the transferable patterns on graphs as computation trees -- i.e., tree structures derived from the message-passing process. Based on this insight, we propose a cross-task, cross-domain graph foundation model named GFT, short for Graph Foundation model with transferable Tree vocabulary. By treating computation trees as tokens within the transferable vocabulary, GFT improves model generalization and reduces the risk of negative transfer. The theoretical analyses and extensive experimental studies have demonstrated the transferability of computation trees and shown the effectiveness of GFT across diverse tasks and domains in graph learning. The open source code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Training of Trustworthy and Energy-Efficient Predictive Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12909v4)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present our work on developing and training scalable, trustworthy, and energy-efficient predictive graph foundation models (GFMs) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier.</p></details> | 51 pages, 32 figures |
| **[GraphCLIP: Enhancing Transferability in Graph Foundation Models for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10329v3)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs.

TAGs are graphs with node and edge features represented in text, which have recently gained wide applicability in training graph-language or graph foundation models. In TAGLAS, we collect and integrate more than 23 TAG datasets with domains ranging from citation graphs to molecule graphs and tasks from node classification to graph question-answering. Unlike previous graph datasets and benchmarks, all datasets in TAGLAS have a unified node and edge text feature format, which allows a graph model to be simultaneously trained and evaluated on multiple datasets from various domains. Further, we provide a standardized, efficient, and simplified way to load all datasets and tasks. We also provide useful utils like text-to-embedding conversion, and graph-to-text conversion, which can facilitate different evaluation scenarios. Finally, we also provide standard and easy-to-use evaluation utils. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/TAGLAS and is still under construction. Please expect more datasets/features in the future.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[LangGFM: A Large Language Model Alone Can be a Powerful Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14961v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently gained significant attention. However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

However, current models often require extensive training or fine-tuning to capture structural and semantic insights on new graphs, which limits their versatility. In this work, we explore graph foundation models from the perspective of zero-shot reasoning on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our focus is on utilizing KGs as a unified topological structure to tackle diverse tasks, while addressing semantic isolation challenges in KG reasoning to effectively integrate diverse semantic and structural features. This brings us new methodological insights into KG reasoning, as well as high generalizability towards foundation models in practice. Methodologically, we introduce SCORE, a unified graph reasoning framework that effectively generalizes diverse graph tasks using zero-shot learning. At the core of SCORE is semantic conditional message passing, a technique designed to capture both structural and semantic invariances in graphs, with theoretical backing for its expressive power. Practically, we evaluate the zero-shot reasoning capability of SCORE using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance improvement over prior foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 5 figures |

However, existing work usually develops separate reasoning models for different KGs, lacking the ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across diverse KGs and reasoning settings. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

| **[Enhance Graph Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11370v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in the real world. Recently, due to the powerful emergent capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in modeling graphs. The key to effectively applying LLMs on graphs is converting graph data into a format LLMs can comprehend. Graph-to-token approaches are popular in enabling LLMs to process graph information. They transform graphs into sequences of tokens and align them with text tokens through instruction tuning, where self-supervised instruction tuning helps LLMs acquire general knowledge about graphs, and supervised fine-tuning specializes LLMs for the downstream tasks on graphs. Despite their initial success, we find that existing methods have a misalignment between self-supervised tasks and supervised downstream tasks, resulting in negative transfer from self-supervised fine-tuning to downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose Graph Alignment Large Language Models (GALLM) to benefit from aligned task templates. In the self-supervised tuning stage, we introduce a novel text matching task using templates aligned with downstream tasks. In the task-specific tuning stage, we propose two category prompt methods that learn supervision information from additional explanation with further aligned templates. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in supervised learning, multi-dataset generalizability, and particularly in zero-shot capability, highlighting the model's potential as a graph foundation model.</p></details> | Under review |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings.

Existing approaches pre-train models for specific graph domains, neglecting the inherent connections within networks. This limits their ability to transfer knowledge to various supervised tasks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy on graphs that focuses on modeling their multi-resolution structural information, allowing us to capture global information of the whole graph while preserving local structures around its nodes. We extend the work of Wave}let Positional Encoding (WavePE) from (Ngo et al., 2023) by pretraining a High-Order Permutation-Equivariant Autoencoder (HOPE-WavePE) to reconstruct node connectivities from their multi-resolution wavelet signals. Unlike existing positional encodings, our method is designed to become sensitivity to the input graph size in downstream tasks, which efficiently capture global structure on graphs. Since our approach relies solely on the graph structure, it is also domain-agnostic and adaptable to datasets from various domains, therefore paving the wave for developing general graph structure encoders and graph foundation models. We theoretically demonstrate that there exists a parametrization of such architecture that it can predict the output adjacency up to arbitrarily low error. We also evaluate HOPE-WavePE on graph-level prediction tasks of different areas and show its superiority compared to other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[On the Scalability of GNNs for Molecular Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11568v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling deep learning models has been at the heart of recent revolutions in language modelling and image generation. Practitioners have observed a strong relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance. However, structure-based architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are yet to show the benefits of scale mainly due to the lower efficiency of sparse operations, large data requirements, and lack of clarity about the effectiveness of various architectures. We address this drawback of GNNs by studying their scaling behavior. Specifically, we analyze message-passing networks, graph Transformers, and hybrid architectures on the largest public collection of 2D molecular graphs. For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules, number of labels, and the diversity in the pretraining datasets. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks. We hope that our work paves the way for an era where foundational GNNs drive pharmaceutical drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Neural Scaling Laws Exist on Graph Self-Supervised Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11243v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning~(SSL) is essential to obtain foundation models in NLP and CV domains via effectively leveraging knowledge in large-scale unlabeled data. The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphFM: A Scalable Framework for Multi-Graph Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks are typically trained on individual datasets, often requiring highly specialized models and extensive hyperparameter tuning. This dataset-specific approach arises because each graph dataset often has unique node features and diverse connectivity structures, making it difficult to build a generalist model. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable multi-graph multi-task pretraining approach specifically tailored for node classification tasks across diverse graph datasets from different domains. Our method, Graph Foundation Model (GraphFM), leverages a Perceiver-based encoder that employs learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a common latent space. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize across different graphs and allows for scaling across diverse data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a model on 152 different graph datasets comprising over 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges, establishing the first set of scaling laws for multi-graph pretraining on datasets spanning many domains (e.g., molecules, citation and product graphs). Our results show that pretraining on a diverse array of real and synthetic graphs improves the model's adaptability and stability, while performing competitively with state-of-the-art specialist models. This work illustrates that multi-graph pretraining can significantly reduce the burden imposed by the current graph training paradigm, unlocking new capabilities for the field of graph neural networks by creating a single generalist model that performs competitively across a wide range of datasets and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOFA: A Generative One-For-All Model for Joint Graph Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09709v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios.

| **[Universal Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14899v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of knowledge graph embedding approaches have been developed. Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the structure of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. We believe our computed embeddings will support the emerging field of graph foundation models. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction suggest that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our source code and datasets open access.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models to generalize and adapt motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> |  |

This is highlighted by the generative capabilities of NLP models like GPT-4, and the retrieval-based approaches of CV models like CLIP, both of which effectively bridge the gap between seen and unseen data. In the realm of graph learning, the continuous emergence of new graphs and the challenges of human labeling also amplify the necessity for zero-shot transfer learning, driving the exploration of approaches that can generalize across diverse graph data without necessitating dataset-specific and label-specific fine-tuning. In this study, we extend such paradigms to zero-shot transferability in graphs by introducing ZeroG, a new framework tailored to enable cross-dataset generalization. Addressing the inherent challenges such as feature misalignment, mismatched label spaces, and negative transfer, we leverage a language model to encode both node attributes and class semantics, ensuring consistent feature dimensions across datasets. We also propose a prompt-based subgraph sampling module that enriches the semantic information and structure information of extracted subgraphs using prompting nodes and neighborhood aggregation, respectively. We further adopt a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that reduces the risk of overfitting and maintains the zero-shot learning efficacy of the language model. The results underscore the effectiveness of our model in achieving significant cross-dataset zero-shot transferability, opening pathways for the development of graph foundation models.

One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach. By successfully leveraging the synergistic potential of multiple graph datasets for pretraining, our work stands as a pioneering contribution to the realm of graph foundational model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD'24, August 25-29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems.

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |

Developing GFMs presents unique challenges over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are typically trained from scratch for specific tasks on particular datasets. The primary challenge in constructing GFMs lies in effectively leveraging vast and diverse graph data to achieve positive transfer. Drawing inspiration from existing foundation models in the CV and NLP domains, we propose a novel perspective for the GFM development by advocating for a ``graph vocabulary'', in which the basic transferable units underlying graphs encode the invariance on graphs. We ground the graph vocabulary construction from essential aspects including network analysis, expressiveness, and stability.

| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models for Personalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07478v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions. In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs). While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval. In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization. Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types. To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity. To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data. Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Hidden Links Between Unseen Security Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02014v1)** | 2024-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of software vulnerabilities poses a significant challenge for security databases and analysts tasked with their timely identification, classification, and remediation. With the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) reporting an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities, the traditional manual analysis becomes untenably time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper introduces VulnScopper, an innovative approach that utilizes multi-modal representation learning, combining Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to automate and enhance the analysis of software vulnerabilities. Leveraging ULTRA, a knowledge graph foundation model, combined with a Large Language Model (LLM), VulnScopper effectively handles unseen entities, overcoming the limitations of previous KG approaches. We evaluate VulnScopper on two major security datasets, the NVD and the Red Hat CVE database. Our method significantly improves the link prediction accuracy between Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs), and Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs). Our results show that VulnScopper outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 78% Hits@10 accuracy in linking CVEs to CPEs and CWEs and presenting an 11.7% improvement over large language models in predicting CWE labels based on the Red Hat database. Based on the NVD, only 6.37% of the linked CPEs are being published during the first 30 days; many of them are related to critical and high-risk vulnerabilities which, according to multiple compliance frameworks (such as CISA and PCI), should be remediated within 15-30 days. Our model can uncover new products linked to vulnerabilities, reducing remediation time and improving vulnerability management. We analyzed several CVEs from 2023 to showcase this ability.</p></details> |  |

However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NAACL 2025.

| **[CLEAR: Cluster-based Prompt Learning on Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08918v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has attracted increasing attention in the graph domain as a means to bridge the gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks confirm the superiority of CLEAR. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5% improvement on the F1 metric for node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[DAGPrompT: Pushing the Limits of Graph Prompting with a Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15142v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-train then fine-tune approach has advanced GNNs by enabling general knowledge capture without task-specific labels. However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

| **[SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Kernel-Aware Graph Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17619v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[LLMs as Zero-shot Graph Learners: Alignment of GNN Representations with LLM Token Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14512v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

A Few-Shot Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11387v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the robotics domain by enabling robots to comprehend and execute natural language instructions. The cornerstone benefits of LLM include processing textual data from technical manuals, instructions, academic papers, and user queries based on the knowledge provided. However, deploying LLM-generated code in robotic systems without safety verification poses significant risks. This paper outlines a safety layer that verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a drone in a simulated environment. The safety layer consists of a fine-tuned GPT-4o model using Few-Shot learning, supported by knowledge graph prompting (KGP). Our approach improves the safety and compliance of robotic actions, ensuring that they adhere to the regulations of drone operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174v2)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over Internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of three fundamental issues: the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we leverage multi-modal prompt learning to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. To accomplish this, we improve state-of-the-art graph prompt method, and then propose the first graph-language multi-modal prompt learning approach for exploiting the knowledge in pre-trained models. Notably, due to the insufficient supervision for fine-tuning, in our paradigm, the pre-trained GNN and the LLM are kept frozen, so the learnable parameters are much fewer than fine-tuning any pre-trained model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.</p></details> | Preprint, 25 pages |
| **[Adapting Unsigned Graph Neural Networks for Signed Graphs: A Few-Shot Prompt Tuning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are powerful tools for signed graph representation learning but struggle with limited generalization and heavy dependence on labeled data. While recent advancements in "graph pre-training and prompt tuning" have reduced label dependence in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and improved their generalization abilities by leveraging pre-training knowledge, these efforts have focused exclusively on unsigned graphs. The scarcity of publicly available signed graph datasets makes it essential to transfer knowledge from unsigned graphs to signed graph tasks. However, this transfer introduces significant challenges due to the graph-level and task-level divergences between the pre-training and downstream phases. To address these challenges, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT) in this paper. Specifically, SGPT employs a graph template and a semantic prompt to segregate mixed link semantics in the signed graph and then adaptively integrate the distinctive semantic information according to the needs of downstream tasks, thereby unifying the pre-training and downstream graphs. Additionally, SGPT utilizes a task template and a feature prompt to reformulate the downstream signed graph tasks, aligning them with pre-training tasks to ensure a unified optimization objective and consistent feature space across tasks. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on popular signed graph datasets, demonstrating the superiority of SGPT over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17676v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph representation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the performance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an end-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTheft: Quantifying Privacy Risks in Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14718v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) represents an innovative approach in graph representation learning, enabling task-specific adaptations by fine-tuning prompts without altering the underlying pre-trained model. Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally focus on a single graph object type (node, edge, graph, etc.) and often overlook the inherent connections among different object types of graph anomalies. For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an abnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this, we present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node, edge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh Quotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by transferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We theoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy of subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant anomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a novel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels, adjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting training goals. Comprehensive experiments show that UniGAD outperforms both existing GAD methods specialized for a single task and graph prompt-based approaches for multiple tasks, while also providing robust zero-shot task transferability.

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model. Various experiments and ablations are done on four datasets including both the C++ and python languages to validate the hard meta-graph prompt, the soft prompting technique, and the effectiveness of the objectives for pretrained GNN expert. CodeGRAG improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |

Identifying specific effects is crucial for developing safer therapies. Previous works on DDI event prediction have typically been limited to using labels of specific events as supervision, which renders them insufficient to address two significant challenges: (1) the bias caused by \textbf{highly imbalanced event distribution} where certain interaction types are vastly under-represented. (2) the \textbf{scarcity of labeled data for rare events}, a pervasive issue where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-explored due to limited available data. In response, we offer ``DDIPrompt'', an innovative solution inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompt learning. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt features a hierarchical pre-training strategy to foster a generalized and comprehensive understanding of drug properties. It captures intra-molecular structures through augmented links based on structural proximity between drugs, further learns inter-molecular interactions emphasizing edge connections rather than concrete catagories. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate DDIPrompt's SOTA performance, especially for those rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

| **[AS-GCL: Asymmetric Spectral Augmentation on Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13525v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as the foremost approach for self-supervised learning on graph-structured data. GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |

However, relying on predefined augmentations (e.g., node dropping, edge perturbation, attribute masking) may result in the loss of task-relevant information and a lack of adaptability to diverse input data. Furthermore, the selection of negative samples remains rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce HyperGCL, a novel multimodal GCL framework from a hypergraph perspective. HyperGCL constructs three distinct hypergraph views by jointly utilizing the input graph's structure and attributes, enabling a comprehensive integration of multiple modalities in contrastive learning. A learnable adaptive topology augmentation technique enhances these views by preserving important relations and filtering out noise. View-specific encoders capture essential characteristics from each view, while a network-aware contrastive loss leverages the underlying topology to define positive and negative samples effectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperGCL achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

However, prior works in EDA have mainly focused on the representation of gate-level digital circuits, failing to capture analog and mixed-signal circuits. To address this gap, we introduce DICE: Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, the first self-supervised pretrained graph neural network (GNN) model for any circuit expressed at the device level. DICE is a message-passing neural network (MPNN) trained through graph contrastive learning, and its pretraining process is simulation-free, incorporating two novel data augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DICE achieves substantial performance gains across three downstream tasks, underscoring its effectiveness for both analog and digital circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning for Connectome Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05109v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EMBC '25</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning Meets Pseudo-label-assisted Mixup Augmentation: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Framework from Local to Global](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18357v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various graph representation learning tasks. However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other. Experimental results across six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that ComGRL achieves excellent performance in node classification tasks. The code could be available at https://github.com/JinluWang1002/ComGRL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16218v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has become a hot topic in the field of graph representation learning. In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations. Theoretical analysis verifies the trustworthiness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art empirical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fusion Self-supervised Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely deployed in various web environments, and self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in this field. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation ($e.g.,$ discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Fusion Self-supervised Learning framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Short Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09219v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short text classification has gained significant attention in the information age due to its prevalence and real-world applications. Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |
| **[Molecular Graph Contrastive Learning with Line Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08589v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trapped by the label scarcity in molecular property prediction and drug design, graph contrastive learning (GCL) came forward. Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission. Furthermore, we present a new patch with edge attribute fusion and two local contrastive losses enhance information transmission and tackle hard negative samples. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for view generation, superior performance on molecular property prediction suggests the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

In this chapter, we have developed a joint multimodal scene graph for charts, explicitly representing the relationships between chart elements and their associated patterns. Our proposed multimodal scene graph consists of two components: a visual graph and a textual graph, each designed to capture the structural and semantic information within the chart. To unify representations across these different modalities, we introduce a multimodal graph contrastive learning approach that learns unified representations by maximizing similarity between nodes representing the same object across multimodal graphs. The learned graph representations can be seamlessly incorporated into a transformer decoder as a soft prompt. Additionally, given the growing need for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in zero-shot scenarios, we have designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts for MLLMs to reduce hallucinations. We tested both methods on public benchmarks such as ChartQA, OpenCQA, and ChartX, demonstrating improved performance and validating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

Effective link prediction on these graphs can uncover valuable connections, such as potential novel drug-disease relations. We introduce a novel multimodal approach that unifies embeddings from specialized Language Models (LMs) with Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) to enhance intra-entity relationships while employing a Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model to capture inter-entity relationships for effective link prediction. To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes. Experimental results on PrimeKG++ and the DrugBank drug-target interaction dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse biomedical datasets.

| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks on Graph-level Tasks: Comprehensive Experiments, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03977v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

| **[CLDG: Contrastive Learning on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14451v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph with complex annotations is the most potent data type, whose constantly evolving motivates further exploration of the unsupervised dynamic graph representation. One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2023 |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," where restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge and enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SE-GCL: An Event-Based Simple and Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Text Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11652v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 tables |

However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs. Experimental results show that compared with recent state-of-the-art GCL methods or even some supervised GNNs, AFECL achieves SOTA performance on link prediction and semi-supervised node classification of extremely scarce labels.

To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |

Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection Using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the power of learning representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the community detection under the community structure semantics and propose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale networks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that minimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is worth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the perspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more accurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy, modularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.</p></details> |  |

However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning via Seamless Proximity Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15270v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aligns node representations by classifying node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented graphs. The conventional GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

However, explicit graph augmentations may lead to a loss of semantics in the contrastive views. Secondly, existing methods tend to overlook edge features and the varying significance of node features during multi-graph learning. Moreover, the contrastive loss suffer from false negatives. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method of contrastive multi-graph learning with neighbor hierarchical sifting for semi-supervised text classification, namely ConNHS. Specifically, we exploit core features to form a multi-relational text graph, enhancing semantic connections among texts. By separating text graphs, we provide diverse views for contrastive learning. Our approach ensures optimal preservation of the graph information, minimizing data loss and distortion. Then, we separately execute relation-aware propagation and cross-graph attention propagation, which effectively leverages the varying correlations between nodes and edge features while harmonising the information fusion across graphs. Subsequently, we present the neighbor hierarchical sifting loss (NHS) to refine the negative selection. For one thing, following the homophily assumption, NHS masks first-order neighbors of the anchor and positives from being negatives. For another, NHS excludes the high-order neighbors analogous to the anchor based on their similarities. Consequently, it effectively reduces the occurrence of false negatives, preventing the expansion of the distance between similar samples in the embedding space. Our experiments on ThuCNews, SogouNews, 20 Newsgroups, and Ohsumed datasets achieved 95.86\%, 97.52\%, 87.43\%, and 70.65\%, which demonstrates competitive results in semi-supervised text classification.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Especially inductive GNNs, which allow for the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. As such these networks become attractive targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing model-stealing attacks that extract models trained on images and texts. However, little attention has been given to stealing GNNs trained on graph data. This paper identifies a new method of performing unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, utilizing graph contrastive learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the targeted model. The new type of attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets and the results show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art by Shen et al. (2021). In particular, our attack surpasses the baseline across all benchmarks, attaining superior fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while necessitating fewer queries directed toward the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI - 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to detect fake news on future events. Recently, numerous fake news detection models that utilize textual information and the propagation structure of posts have been proposed. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge since they rely heavily on event-specific features for prediction and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce \textbf{F}uture \textbf{AD}aptive \textbf{E}vent-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to obtain higher-quality features and make more accurate overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. We further mitigate event bias by subtracting the event-only predictor's output from the target predictor's output to obtain the final prediction. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of graph characteristics while controlling the distribution of generated subgraphs. We employ optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGEC outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |

However, the label information is not always effectively utilized in the traditional GCN framework. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (\ie ELU-graph), which enables GCNs to effectively utilize label information. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of 77.53% while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions series journal</p></details> |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The one of the effective ways to reduce the number of samples is using hard negatives (e.g., Mixup). Designing mixing-based approach for GAD can be difficult due to imbalanced data or limited number of anomalies. We propose ANOMIX, a framework that consists of a novel graph mixing approach, ANOMIX-M, and multi-level contrasts for GAD. ANOMIX-M can effectively mix abnormality and normality from input graph to generate hard negatives, which are important for efficient GCL. ANOMIX is (a) A first mixing approach: firstly attempting graph mixing to generate hard negatives for GAD task and node- and subgraph-level contrasts to distinguish underlying anomalies. (b) Accurate: winning the highest AUC, up to 5.49% higher and 1.76% faster. (c) Effective: reducing the number of samples nearly 80% in GCL.

As IoT devices proliferate and rapidly evolve, their highly heterogeneous hardware architectures and complex compilation settings, coupled with the demand for large-scale function retrieval in practical applications, put forward higher requirements for BCSD methods. In this paper, we propose IRBinDiff, which mitigates compilation differences by leveraging LLVM-IR with higher-level semantic abstraction, and integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph neural network to capture both semantic and structural information from different perspectives. By introducing momentum contrastive learning, it effectively enhances retrieval capabilities in large-scale candidate function sets, distinguishing between subtle function similarities and differences. Our extensive experiments, conducted under varied compilation settings, demonstrate that IRBinDiff outperforms other leading BCSD methods in both One-to-one comparison and One-to-many search scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

A recommender system is considered unfair when it produces unequal outcomes for different user groups based on user-sensitive attributes (e.g., age, gender). Some researchers have proposed data augmentation-based methods aiming at alleviating user-level unfairness by altering the skewed distribution of training data among various user groups. Despite yielding promising results, they often rely on fairness-related assumptions that may not align with reality, potentially reducing the data quality and negatively affecting model effectiveness. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study how to implement high-quality data augmentation to improve recommendation fairness. Specifically, we propose FairDgcl, a dynamic graph adversarial contrastive learning framework aiming at improving fairness in recommender system. First, FairDgcl develops an adversarial contrastive network with a view generator and a view discriminator to learn generating fair augmentation strategies in an adversarial style. Then, we propose two dynamic, learnable models to generate contrastive views within contrastive learning framework, which automatically fine-tune the augmentation strategies. Meanwhile, we theoretically show that FairDgcl can simultaneously generate enhanced representations that possess both fairness and accuracy. Lastly, comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FairDgcl.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to TKDE</p></details> |

The existing research on efficient data augmentation methods and ideal pretext tasks for graph contrastive learning remains limited, resulting in suboptimal node representation in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we introduce LAC, a graph contrastive learning framework with learnable data augmentation in an orthogonal continuous space. To capture the representative information in the graph data during augmentation, we introduce a continuous view augmenter, that applies both a masked topology augmentation module and a cross-channel feature augmentation module to adaptively augment the topological information and the feature information within an orthogonal continuous space, respectively. The orthogonal nature of continuous space ensures that the augmentation process avoids dimension collapse. To enhance the effectiveness of pretext tasks, we propose an information-theoretic principle named InfoBal and introduce corresponding pretext tasks. These tasks enable the continuous view augmenter to maintain consistency in the representative information across views while maximizing diversity between views, and allow the encoder to fully utilize the representative information in the unsupervised setting. Our experimental results show that LAC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCL-based text classification methods often suffer from negative sampling bias, where similar nodes are incorrectly paired as negative pairs. This can lead to over-clustering, where instances of the same class are divided into different clusters. To address the over-clustering issue, we propose an innovative GCL-based method of graph contrastive learning via cluster-refined negative sampling for semi-supervised text classification, namely ClusterText. Firstly, we combine the pre-trained model Bert with graph neural networks to learn text representations. Secondly, we introduce a clustering refinement strategy, which clusters the learned text representations to obtain pseudo labels. For each text node, its negative sample set is drawn from different clusters. Additionally, we propose a self-correction mechanism to mitigate the loss of true negative samples caused by clustering inconsistency. By calculating the Euclidean distance between each text node and other nodes within the same cluster, distant nodes are still selected as negative samples. Our proposed ClusterText demonstrates good scalable computing, as it can effectively extract important information from from a large amount of data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ClusterText in text classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Our study finds that the difference in high-frequency information between augmented graphs is greater than that in low-frequency information. However, most existing GCL methods focus mainly on the time domain (low-frequency information) for node feature representations and cannot make good use of high-frequency information to speed up model convergence. Furthermore, existing GCL paradigms optimize graph embedding representations by pulling the distance between positive sample pairs closer and pushing the distance between positive and negative sample pairs farther away, but our theoretical analysis shows that graph contrastive learning benefits from pushing negative pairs farther away rather than pulling positive pairs closer. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel spectral GCL framework without positive samples, named SpeGCL. Specifically, to solve the problem that existing GCL methods cannot utilize high-frequency information, SpeGCL uses a Fourier transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency information of node features, and constructs a contrastive learning mechanism in a Fourier space to obtain better node feature representation. Furthermore, SpeGCL relies entirely on negative samples to refine the graph embedding. We also provide a theoretical justification for the efficacy of using only negative samples in SpeGCL. Extensive experiments on un-supervised learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning have validated the superiority of our SpeGCL framework over the state-of-the-art GCL methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

These changes lead to temporal degradation in entity linking models, characterized as a decline in model performance over time. To address this issue, we propose leveraging graph relationships to aggregate information from neighboring entities across different time periods. This approach enhances the ability to distinguish similar entities over time, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal degradation. We introduce \textbf{CYCLE}: \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{Y}ear \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{E}ntity-Linking. This model employs a novel graph contrastive learning method to tackle temporal performance degradation in entity linking tasks. Our contrastive learning method treats newly added graph relationships as \textit{positive} samples and newly removed ones as \textit{negative} samples. This approach helps our model effectively prevent temporal degradation, achieving a 13.90\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art from 2023 when the time gap is one year, and a 17.79\% improvement as the gap expands to three years. Further analysis shows that CYCLE is particularly robust for low-degree entities, which are less resistant to temporal degradation due to their sparse connectivity, making them particularly suitable for our method.

| **[Towards Cross-domain Few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08629v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot graph anomaly detection (GAD) has recently garnered increasing attention, which aims to discern anomalous patterns among abundant unlabeled test nodes under the guidance of a limited number of labeled training nodes. Existing few-shot GAD approaches typically adopt meta-training methods trained on richly labeled auxiliary networks to facilitate rapid adaptation to target networks that possess sparse labels. However, these proposed methods often assume that the auxiliary and target networks exist in the same data distributions-an assumption rarely holds in practical settings. This paper explores a more prevalent and complex scenario of cross-domain few-shot GAD, where the goal is to identify anomalies within sparsely labeled target graphs using auxiliary graphs from a related, yet distinct domain. The challenge here is nontrivial owing to inherent data distribution discrepancies between the source and target domains, compounded by the uncertainties of sparse labeling in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework, termed CDFS-GAD, specifically designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. CDFS-GAD first introduces a domain-adaptive graph contrastive learning module, which is aimed at enhancing cross-domain feature alignment. Then, a prompt tuning module is further designed to extract domain-specific features tailored to each domain. Moreover, a domain-adaptive hypersphere classification loss is proposed to enhance the discrimination between normal and anomalous instances under minimal supervision, utilizing domain-sensitive norms. Lastly, a self-training strategy is introduced to further refine the predicted scores, enhancing its reliability in few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on twelve real-world cross-domain data pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDFS-GAD framework in comparison to various existing GAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 24th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2024)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of contrastive learning are still not well understood. In this paper, we challenge the conventional use of random augmentations on graph structure or embedding space in GCL, which may disrupt the structural and semantic information inherent in Graph Neural Networks. Moreover, fixed-rate data augmentation proves to be less effective compared to augmentation with an adaptive rate. In the initial training phases, significant perturbations are more suitable, while as the training approaches convergence, milder perturbations yield better results. We introduce a twin encoder in place of random augmentations, demonstrating the redundancy of traditional augmentation techniques. The twin encoder updating mechanism ensures the generation of more diverse contrastive views in the early stages, transitioning to views with greater similarity as training progresses. In addition, we investigate the learned representations from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on a hypersphere to optimize more efficiently. Our proposed Twin Graph Contrastive Learning model -- TwinCL -- aligns positive pairs of user and item embeddings and the representations from the twin encoder while maintaining the uniformity of the embeddings on the hypersphere. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed model optimizing alignment and uniformity with the twin encoder contributes to better recommendation accuracy and training efficiency performance. In comprehensive experiments on three public datasets, our proposed TwinCL achieves an average improvement of 5.6% (NDCG@10) in recommendation accuracy with faster training speed, while effectively mitigating popularity bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Emojis in Texts via Self-supervised Graph Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14552v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emojis have gained immense popularity on social platforms, serving as a common means to supplement or replace text. However, existing data mining approaches generally either completely ignore or simply treat emojis as ordinary Unicode characters, which may limit the model's ability to grasp the rich semantic information in emojis and the interaction between emojis and texts. Thus, it is necessary to release the emoji's power in social media data mining. To this end, we first construct a heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes, i.e. post, word and emoji nodes to improve the representation of different elements in posts. The edges are also well-defined to model how these three elements interact with each other. To facilitate the sharing of information among post, word and emoji nodes, we propose a graph pre-train framework for text and emoji co-modeling, which contains two graph pre-training tasks: node-level graph contrastive learning and edge-level link reconstruction learning. Extensive experiments on the Xiaohongshu and Twitter datasets with two types of downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach proves significant improvement over previous strong baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Multiplex Graph Contrastive Learning with Soft Negatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08010v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) seeks to learn nodal or graph representations that contain maximal consistent information from graph-structured data. While node-level contrasting modes are dominating, some efforts commence to explore consistency across different scales. Yet, they tend to lose consistent information and be contaminated by disturbing features. Here, we introduce MUX-GCL, a novel cross-scale contrastive learning paradigm that utilizes multiplex representations as effective patches. While this learning mode minimizes contaminating noises, a commensurate contrasting strategy using positional affinities further avoids information loss by correcting false negative pairs across scales. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate that MUX-GCL yields multiple state-of-the-art results on public datasets. Our theoretical analysis further guarantees the new objective function as a stricter lower bound of mutual information of raw input features and output embeddings, which rationalizes this paradigm.

| **[GRE^2-MDCL: Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07725v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for preserving graph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various downstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised node clustering via contrastive hard sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07718v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a fine-grained contrastive learning scheme for unsupervised node clustering. Previous clustering methods only focus on a small feature set (class-dependent features), which demonstrates explicit clustering characteristics, ignoring the rest of the feature spaces (class-invariant features). This paper exploits class-invariant features via graph contrastive learning to discover additional high-quality features for unsupervised clustering. We formulate a novel node-level fine-grained augmentation framework for self-supervised learning, which iteratively identifies competitive contrastive samples from the whole feature spaces, in the form of positive and negative examples of node relations. While positive examples of node relations are usually expressed as edges in graph homophily, negative examples are implicit without a direct edge. We show, however, that simply sampling nodes beyond the local neighborhood results in less competitive negative pairs, that are less effective for contrastive learning. Inspired by counterfactual augmentation, we instead sample competitive negative node relations by creating virtual nodes that inherit (in a self-supervised fashion) class-invariant features, while altering class-dependent features, creating contrasting pairs that lie closer to the boundary and offering better contrast. Consequently, our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in supervised node clustering tasks on six baselines and six real-world social network datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMP: Learnable Meta-Path Guided Adversarial Contrastive Learning for Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06323v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have significantly propelled the information retrieval (IR) field. Still, the effectiveness of HGNNs heavily relies on high-quality labels, which are often expensive to acquire. This challenge has shifted attention towards Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), which usually requires pre-defined meta-paths. However, our findings reveal that meta-path combinations significantly affect performance in unsupervised settings, an aspect often overlooked in current literature. Existing HGCL methods have considerable variability in outcomes across different meta-path combinations, thereby challenging the optimization process to achieve consistent and high performance. In response, we introduce \textsf{LAMP} (\underline{\textbf{L}}earn\underline{\textbf{A}}ble \underline{\textbf{M}}eta-\underline{\textbf{P}}ath), a novel adversarial contrastive learning approach that integrates various meta-path sub-graphs into a unified and stable structure, leveraging the overlap among these sub-graphs. To address the denseness of this integrated sub-graph, we propose an adversarial training strategy for edge pruning, maintaining sparsity to enhance model performance and robustness. \textsf{LAMP} aims to maximize the difference between meta-path and network schema views for guiding contrastive learning to capture the most meaningful information. Our extensive experimental study conducted on four diverse datasets from the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) demonstrates that \textsf{LAMP} significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised models in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spectral-Aware Augmentation for Enhanced Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13845v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in learning representations on graphs in recent years. To generate ideal augmentation views, the augmentation generation methods should preserve essential information while discarding less relevant details for downstream tasks. However, current augmentation methods usually involve random topology corruption in the spatial domain, which fails to adequately address information spread across different frequencies in the spectral domain. Our preliminary study highlights this issue, demonstrating that spatial random perturbations impact all frequency bands almost uniformly. Given that task-relevant information typically resides in specific spectral regions that vary across graphs, this one-size-fits-all approach can pose challenges. We argue that indiscriminate spatial random perturbation might unintentionally weaken task-relevant information, reducing its effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, we propose applying perturbations selectively, focusing on information specific to different frequencies across diverse graphs. In this paper, we present GASSER, a model that applies tailored perturbations to specific frequencies of graph structures in the spectral domain, guided by spectral hints. Through extensive experimentation and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the augmentation views generated by GASSER are adaptive, controllable, and intuitively aligned with the homophily ratios and spectrum of graph structures.</p></details> |  |

However, GCL for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has yet to be explored. Because conventional augmentation techniques like feature embedding masking cannot directly process textual attributes on TAGs. A naive strategy for applying GCL to TAGs is to encode the textual attributes into feature embeddings via a language model and then feed the embeddings into the following GCL module for processing. Such a strategy faces three key challenges: I) failure to avoid information loss, II) semantic loss during the text encoding phase, and III) implicit augmentation constraints that lead to uncontrollable and incomprehensible results. In this paper, we propose a novel GCL framework named LATEX-GCL to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce textual augmentations and LLMs' powerful natural language processing (NLP) abilities to address the three limitations aforementioned to pave the way for applying GCL to TAG tasks. Extensive experiments on four high-quality TAG datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed LATEX-GCL method. The source codes and datasets are released to ease the reproducibility, which can be accessed via this link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LATEX-GCL-0712.</p></details> |  |

In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

The MER task extracts and fuses complementary semantic information from different modalities, which can classify the speaker's emotions. However, the existing feature fusion methods have usually mapped the features of different modalities into the same feature space for information fusion, which can not eliminate the heterogeneity between different modalities. Therefore, it is challenging to make the subsequent emotion class boundary learning. To tackle the above problems, we have proposed a novel Adversarial Representation with Intra-Modal and Inter-Modal Graph Contrastive for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (AR-IIGCN) method. Firstly, we input video, audio, and text features into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map them into separate feature spaces. Secondly, we build a generator and a discriminator for the three modal features through adversarial representation, which can achieve information interaction between modalities and eliminate heterogeneity among modalities. Thirdly, we introduce contrastive graph representation learning to capture intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information and learn intra-class and inter-class boundary information of emotion categories. Specifically, we construct a graph structure for three modal features and perform contrastive representation learning on nodes with different emotions in the same modality and the same emotion in different modalities, which can improve the feature representation ability of nodes. Extensive experimental works show that the ARL-IIGCN method can significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Most existing GCL-based recommenders generate contrastive views by altering the graph structure or introducing perturbations to embedding. While these methods effectively enhance learning from sparse data, they risk performance degradation or even training collapse when the differences between contrastive views become too pronounced. To mitigate this issue, we employ curriculum learning to incrementally increase the disparity between contrastive views, enabling the model to gain from more challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a dual-adversarial graph learning approach, AvoGCL, which emulates curriculum learning by progressively applying adversarial training to graph structures and embedding perturbations. Specifically, AvoGCL construct contrastive views by reducing graph redundancy and generating adversarial perturbations in the embedding space, and achieve better results by gradually increasing the difficulty of contrastive views. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AvoGCL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the co-existence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudo labels generated from the source model. In this paper, we propose a new method called Evidential Contrastive Alignment (ECA) to decouple the blending target domain and alleviate the effect from noisy target pseudo labels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of a same class in the blended target domains, which alleviates the co-existence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets and ECA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.</p></details> |  |

Integration of CL with graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative filterings (CFs) has been explored in recommender systems. However, current CL-based recommendation models heavily rely on low-pass filters and graph augmentations. In this paper, inspired by the reaction-diffusion equation, we propose a novel CL method for recommender systems called the reaction-diffusion graph contrastive learning model (RDGCL). We design our own GCN for CF based on the equations of diffusion, i.e., low-pass filter, and reaction, i.e., high-pass filter. Our proposed CL-based training occurs between reaction and diffusion-based embeddings, so there is no need for graph augmentations. Experimental evaluation on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CL-based recommendation models. By enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversity, our method brings an advancement in CL for recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Jeong...</summary><p>Jeongwhan Choi and Hyowon Wi are co-first authors with equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Task Curriculum Graph Contrastive Learning with Clustering Entropy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12071v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unsupervised deep graph clustering have been significantly promoted by contrastive learning. Despite the strides, most graph contrastive learning models face challenges: 1) graph augmentation is used to improve learning diversity, but commonly used random augmentation methods may destroy inherent semantics and cause noise; 2) the fixed positive and negative sample selection strategy is limited to deal with complex real data, thereby impeding the model's capability to capture fine-grained patterns and relationships. To reduce these problems, we propose the Clustering-guided Curriculum Graph contrastive Learning (CCGL) framework. CCGL uses clustering entropy as the guidance of the following graph augmentation and contrastive learning. Specifically, according to the clustering entropy, the intra-class edges and important features are emphasized in augmentation. Then, a multi-task curriculum learning scheme is proposed, which employs the clustering guidance to shift the focus from the discrimination task to the clustering task. In this way, the sample selection strategy of contrastive learning can be adjusted adaptively from early to late stage, which enhances the model's flexibility for complex data structure. Experimental results demonstrate that CCGL has achieved excellent performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Latent Factor Analysis Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04838v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful learning methods for recommender systems owing to their robustness in handling complicated user-item interactions. Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue of highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e., nodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to construct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only brings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals effectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA) enhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to implement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an augmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise signals. Experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed LFA-GCL outperforms the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing augmentation methods, such as directly perturbing interaction graph (e.g., node/edge dropout), may interfere with the original connections and generate poor contrasting views, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we define the views that share only a small amount of information with the original graph due to poor data augmentation as noisy views (i.e., the last 20% of the views with a cosine similarity value less than 0.1 to the original view). We demonstrate through detailed experiments that noisy views will significantly degrade recommendation performance. Further, we propose a model-agnostic Symmetric Graph Contrastive Learning (SGCL) method with theoretical guarantees to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce symmetry theory into graph contrastive learning, based on which we propose a symmetric form and contrast loss resistant to noisy interference. We provide theoretical proof that our proposed SGCL method has a high tolerance to noisy views. Further demonstration is given by conducting extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases recommendation accuracy, with relative improvements reaching as high as 12.25% over nine other competing models. These results highlight the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, submitted to TOIS</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of labeled data remains a major challenge in this field, limiting the widespread use of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, a semi-supervised Dual-stream Self-Attentive Adversarial Graph Contrastive learning framework (termed as DS-AGC) is proposed to tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. The DS-AGC framework includes two parallel streams for extracting non-structural and structural EEG features. The non-structural stream incorporates a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation method to alleviate distribution discrepancy among labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and unknown target domain. The structural stream develops a graph contrastive learning method to extract effective graph-based feature representation from multiple EEG channels in a semi-supervised manner. Further, a self-attentive fusion module is developed for feature fusion, sample selection, and emotion recognition, which highlights EEG features more relevant to emotions and data samples in the labeled source domain that are closer to the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) using a semi-supervised cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation scheme show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods under different incomplete label conditions (with an average improvement of 5.83% on SEED and 6.99% on SEED-IV), demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the label scarcity problem in cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.06496</p></details> |

Despite the success of GNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a small number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always contain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node representations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be effective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most existing GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to create multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information (MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature representation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple contrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information irrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an effective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which can adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the optimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in multiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible about node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original views and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to improve the robustness of node feature representation. Extensive experiments on real-world public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Recent graph learning-driven models have made remarkable progress in the field of recommendation, but their performance in the academic reviewer recommendation task may suffer from a significant false negative issue. This arises from the assumption that unobserved edges represent negative samples. In fact, the mechanism of anonymous review results in inadequate exposure of interactions between reviewers and submissions, leading to a higher number of unobserved interactions compared to those caused by reviewers declining to participate. Therefore, investigating how to better comprehend the negative labeling of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations is a significant challenge. This study aims to tackle the ambiguous nature of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Pseudo Neg-Label strategy to enhance graph contrastive learning (GCL) for recommending reviewers for academic submissions, which we call RevGNN. RevGNN utilizes a two-stage encoder structure that encodes both scientific knowledge and behavior using Pseudo Neg-Label to approximate review preference. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RevGNN outperforms all baselines across four metrics. Additionally, detailed further analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component in RevGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks often neglect the fact that user-item interactions within HG are governed by diverse latent intents (e.g., brand preferences or demographic characteristics of item audiences), which are pivotal in capturing fine-grained relations. The exploration of these underlying intents, particularly through the lens of meta-paths in HGs, presents us with two principal challenges: i) How to integrate CL with intents; ii) How to mitigate noise from meta-path-driven intents. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework termed Intent-guided Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (IHGCL), which designed to enhance CL-based recommendation by capturing the intents contained within meta-paths. Specifically, the IHGCL framework includes: i) a meta-path-based Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) approach to effectively integrate intents into the recommendation, constructing intent-intent contrast and intent-interaction contrast; ii) a Bottlenecked AutoEncoder (BAE) that combines mask propagation with the information bottleneck principle to significantly reduce noise perturbations introduced by meta-paths. Empirical evaluations conducted across six distinct datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our IHGCL framework relative to conventional baseline methods. Our model implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IHGCL.</p></details> | 14pages, 11figures |
| **[Your Graph Recommender is Provably a Single-view Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17723v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph recommender (GR) is a type of graph neural network (GNNs) encoder that is customized for extracting information from the user-item interaction graph. Due to its strong performance on the recommendation task, GR has gained significant attention recently. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is also a popular research direction that aims to learn, often unsupervised, GNNs with certain contrastive objectives. As a general graph representation learning method, GCLs have been widely adopted with the supervised recommendation loss for joint training of GRs. Despite the intersection of GR and GCL research, theoretical understanding of the relationship between the two fields is surprisingly sparse. This vacancy inevitably leads to inefficient scientific research. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between the field of GR and GCL from the perspective of encoders and loss functions. With mild assumptions, we theoretically show an astonishing fact that graph recommender is equivalent to a commonly-used single-view graph contrastive model. Specifically, we find that (1) the classic encoder in GR is essentially a linear graph convolutional network with one-hot inputs, and (2) the loss function in GR is well bounded by a single-view GCL loss with certain hyperparameters. The first observation enables us to explain crucial designs of GR models, e.g., the removal of self-loop and nonlinearity. And the second finding can easily prompt many cross-field research directions. We empirically show a remarkable result that the recommendation loss and the GCL loss can be used interchangeably. The fact that we can train GR models solely with the GCL loss is particularly insightful, since before this work, GCLs were typically viewed as unsupervised methods that need fine-tuning. We also discuss some potential future works inspired by our theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Reorganized Graph Contrastive Learning with Mitigating Semantic Drift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16726v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is an effective paradigm for node representation learning in graphs. The key components hidden behind GCL are data augmentation and positive-negative pair selection. Typical data augmentations in GCL, such as uniform deletion of edges, are generally blind and resort to local perturbation, which is prone to producing under-diversity views. Additionally, there is a risk of making the augmented data traverse to other classes. Moreover, most methods always treat all other samples as negatives. Such a negative pairing naturally results in sampling bias and likewise may make the learned representation suffer from semantic drift. Therefore, to increase the diversity of the contrastive view, we propose two simple and effective global topological augmentations to compensate current GCL. One is to mine the semantic correlation between nodes in the feature space. The other is to utilize the algebraic properties of the adjacency matrix to characterize the topology by eigen-decomposition. With the help of both, we can retain important edges to build a better view. To reduce the risk of semantic drift, a prototype-based negative pair selection is further designed which can filter false negative samples. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the advantages of the model compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Recommendation via Decision Boundary-aware Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10184v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has received increasing attention in recommender systems due to its effectiveness in reducing bias caused by data sparsity. However, most existing GCL models rely on heuristic approaches and usually assume entity independence when constructing contrastive views. We argue that these methods struggle to strike a balance between semantic invariance and view hardness across the dynamic training process, both of which are critical factors in graph contrastive learning. To address the above issues, we propose a novel GCL-based recommendation framework RGCL, which effectively maintains the semantic invariance of contrastive pairs and dynamically adapts as the model capability evolves through the training process. Specifically, RGCL first introduces decision boundary-aware adversarial perturbations to constrain the exploration space of contrastive augmented views, avoiding the decrease of task-specific information. Furthermore, to incorporate global user-user and item-item collaboration relationships for guiding on the generation of hard contrastive views, we propose an adversarial-contrastive learning objective to construct a relation-aware view-generator. Besides, considering that unsupervised GCL could potentially narrower margins between data points and the decision boundary, resulting in decreased model robustness, we introduce the adversarial examples based on maximum perturbations to achieve margin maximization. We also provide theoretical analyses on the effectiveness of our designs. Through extensive experiments on five public datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of RGCL compared against twelve baseline models.</p></details> | KDD 2024 |
| **[L^2CL: Embarrassingly Simple Layer-to-Layer Contrastive Learning for Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14266v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as an effective approach to model neighborhood signals in collaborative filtering. Towards this research line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) demonstrates robust capabilities to address the supervision label shortage issue through generating massive self-supervised signals. Despite its effectiveness, GCL for recommendation suffers seriously from two main challenges: i) GCL relies on graph augmentation to generate semantically different views for contrasting, which could potentially disrupt key information and introduce unwanted noise; ii) current works for GCL primarily focus on contrasting representations using sophisticated networks architecture (usually deep) to capture high-order interactions, which leads to increased computational complexity and suboptimal training efficiency. To this end, we propose L2CL, a principled Layer-to-Layer Contrastive Learning framework that contrasts representations from different layers. By aligning the semantic similarities between different layers, L2CL enables the learning of complex structural relationships and gets rid of the noise perturbation in stochastic data augmentation. Surprisingly, we find that L2CL, using only one-hop contrastive learning paradigm, is able to capture intrinsic semantic structures and improve the quality of node representation, leading to a simple yet effective architecture. We also provide theoretical guarantees for L2CL in minimizing task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/downeykking/L2CL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency and Discrepancy-Based Contrastive Tripartite Graph Learning for Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05126v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tripartite graph-based recommender systems markedly diverge from traditional models by recommending unique combinations such as user groups and item bundles. Despite their effectiveness, these systems exacerbate the longstanding cold-start problem in traditional recommender systems, because any number of user groups or item bundles can be formed among users or items. To address this issue, we introduce a Consistency and Discrepancy-based graph contrastive learning method for tripartite graph-based Recommendation. This approach leverages two novel meta-path-based metrics consistency and discrepancy to capture nuanced, implicit associations between the recommended objects and the recommendees. These metrics, indicative of high-order similarities, can be efficiently calculated with infinite graph convolutional networks layers under a multi-objective optimization framework, using the limit theory of GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning with Spectral Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00708v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graphs can well describe the complex entity relationships in the real world. For example, online shopping networks contain multiple physical types of consumers and products, as well as multiple relationship types such as purchasing and favoriting. More and more scholars pay attention to this research because heterogeneous graph representation learning shows strong application potential in real-world scenarios. However, the existing heterogeneous graph models use data augmentation techniques to enhance the use of graph structure information, which only captures the graph structure information from the spatial topology, ignoring the information displayed in the spectrum dimension of the graph structure. To address the issue that heterogeneous graph representation learning methods fail to model spectral information, this paper introduces a spectral-enhanced graph contrastive learning model (SHCL) and proposes a spectral augmentation algorithm for the first time in heterogeneous graph neural networks. The proposed model learns an adaptive topology augmentation scheme through the heterogeneous graph itself, disrupting the structural information of the heterogeneous graph in the spectrum dimension, and ultimately improving the learning effect of the model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate substantial advantages of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoGCL: Topological Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17251v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a new concept which allows for capitalizing on the strengths of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn rich representations in a wide variety of applications which involve abundant unlabeled information. However, existing GCL approaches largely tend to overlook the important latent information on higher-order graph substructures. We address this limitation by introducing the concepts of topological invariance and extended persistence on graphs to GCL. In particular, we propose a new contrastive mode which targets topological representations of the two augmented views from the same graph, yielded by extracting latent shape properties of the graph at multiple resolutions. Along with the extended topological layer, we introduce a new extended persistence summary, namely, extended persistence landscapes (EPL) and derive its theoretical stability guarantees. Our extensive numerical results on biological, chemical, and social interaction graphs show that the new Topological Graph Contrastive Learning (TopoGCL) model delivers significant performance gains in unsupervised graph classification for 11 out of 12 considered datasets and also exhibits robustness under noisy scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Overfitting to Robustness: Quantity, Quality, and Variety Oriented Negative Sample Selection in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15044v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to contrast positive-negative counterparts to learn the node embeddings, whereas graph data augmentation methods are employed to generate these positive-negative samples. The variation, quantity, and quality of negative samples compared to positive samples play crucial roles in learning meaningful embeddings for node classification downstream tasks. Less variation, excessive quantity, and low-quality negative samples cause the model to be overfitted for particular nodes, resulting in less robust models. To solve the overfitting problem in the GCL paradigm, this study proposes a novel Cumulative Sample Selection (CSS) algorithm by comprehensively considering negative samples' quality, variations, and quantity. Initially, three negative sample pools are constructed: easy, medium, and hard negative samples, which contain 25%, 50%, and 25% of the total available negative samples, respectively. Then, 10% negative samples are selected from each of these three negative sample pools for training the model. After that, a decision agent module evaluates model training results and decides whether to explore more negative samples from three negative sample pools by increasing the ratio or keep exploiting the current sampling ratio. The proposed algorithm is integrated into a proposed graph contrastive learning framework named NegAmplify. NegAmplify is compared with the SOTA methods on nine graph node classification datasets, with seven achieving better node classification accuracy with up to 2.86% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Modularity Maximization for Graph Clustering: A Contrastive Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14288v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph clustering, a fundamental and challenging task in graph mining, aims to classify nodes in a graph into several disjoint clusters. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a dominant line of research in graph clustering and advances the new state-of-the-art. However, GCL-based methods heavily rely on graph augmentations and contrastive schemes, which may potentially introduce challenges such as semantic drift and scalability issues. Another promising line of research involves the adoption of modularity maximization, a popular and effective measure for community detection, as the guiding principle for clustering tasks. Despite the recent progress, the underlying mechanism of modularity maximization is still not well understood. In this work, we dig into the hidden success of modularity maximization for graph clustering. Our analysis reveals the strong connections between modularity maximization and graph contrastive learning, where positive and negative examples are naturally defined by modularity. In light of our results, we propose a community-aware graph clustering framework, coined MAGI, which leverages modularity maximization as a contrastive pretext task to effectively uncover the underlying information of communities in graphs, while avoiding the problem of semantic drift. Extensive experiments on multiple graph datasets verify the effectiveness of MAGI in terms of scalability and clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art graph clustering methods. Notably, MAGI easily scales a sufficiently large graph with 100M nodes while outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2024 research track.

However, the cost for collecting ST data is much higher than acquiring histopathological images, and thus several studies attempt to predict the gene expression on ST by leveraging their corresponding histopathological images. Most of the existing image-based gene prediction models treat the prediction task on each spot of ST data independently, which ignores the spatial dependency among spots. In addition, while the histology images share phenotypic characteristics with the ST data, it is still challenge to extract such common information to help align paired image and expression representations. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning framework with HSIC-bottleneck Regularization(ST-GCHB) aiming at learning shared representation to help impute the gene expression of the queried imagingspots by considering their spatial dependency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAugLLM: Improving Graph Contrastive Learning for Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11945v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies self-supervised graph learning for text-attributed graphs (TAGs) where nodes are represented by textual attributes. Unlike traditional graph contrastive methods that perturb the numerical feature space and alter the graph's topological structure, we aim to improve view generation through language supervision. This is driven by the prevalence of textual attributes in real applications, which complement graph structures with rich semantic information. However, this presents challenges because of two major reasons. First, text attributes often vary in length and quality, making it difficulty to perturb raw text descriptions without altering their original semantic meanings. Second, although text attributes complement graph structures, they are not inherently well-aligned. To bridge the gap, we introduce GAugLLM, a novel framework for augmenting TAGs. It leverages advanced large language models like Mistral to enhance self-supervised graph learning. Specifically, we introduce a mixture-of-prompt-expert technique to generate augmented node features. This approach adaptively maps multiple prompt experts, each of which modifies raw text attributes using prompt engineering, into numerical feature space. Additionally, we devise a collaborative edge modifier to leverage structural and textual commonalities, enhancing edge augmentation by examining or building connections between nodes. Empirical results across five benchmark datasets spanning various domains underscore our framework's ability to enhance the performance of leading contrastive methods as a plug-in tool. Notably, we observe that the augmented features and graph structure can also enhance the performance of standard generative methods, as well as popular graph neural networks. The open-sourced implementation of our GAugLLM is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

However, their generalization performance degrades when noisy labels are present in the training data. Most existing noisy labeling approaches focus on the visual domain or graph node classification tasks and analyze the impact of noisy labels only from a utility perspective. Unlike existing work, in this paper, we measure the effects of noise labels on graph classification from data privacy and model utility perspectives. We find that noise labels degrade the model's generalization performance and enhance the ability of membership inference attacks on graph data privacy. To this end, we propose the robust graph neural network approach with noisy labeled graph classification. Specifically, we first accurately filter the noisy samples by high-confidence samples and the first feature principal component vector of each class. Then, the robust principal component vectors and the model output under data augmentation are utilized to achieve noise label correction guided by dual spatial information. Finally, supervised graph contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the embedding quality of the model and protect the privacy of the training graph data. The utility and privacy of the proposed method are validated by comparing twelve different methods on eight real graph classification datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the RGLC method achieves at most and at least 7.8% and 0.8% performance gain at 30% noisy labeling rate, respectively, and reduces the accuracy of privacy attacks to below 60%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning under Heterophily via Graph Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06344v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (CL) methods learn node representations in a self-supervised manner by maximizing the similarity between the augmented node representations obtained via a GNN-based encoder. However, CL methods perform poorly on graphs with heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes. In this work, we address this problem by proposing an effective graph CL method, namely HLCL, for learning graph representations under heterophily. HLCL first identifies a homophilic and a heterophilic subgraph based on the cosine similarity of node features. It then uses a low-pass and a high-pass graph filter to aggregate representations of nodes connected in the homophilic subgraph and differentiate representations of nodes in the heterophilic subgraph. The final node representations are learned by contrasting both the augmented high-pass filtered views and the augmented low-pass filtered node views. Our extensive experiments show that HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art graph CL methods on benchmark datasets with heterophily, as well as large-scale real-world graphs, by up to 7%, and outperforms graph supervised learning methods on datasets with heterophily by up to 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Road Network Representation Learning with the Third Law of Geography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04038v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road network representation learning aims to learn compressed and effective vectorized representations for road segments that are applicable to numerous tasks. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response, we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority. We provide our codes at https://github.com/gongchenghua/Self-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 findings</p></details> |

Traditional GCL methods utilize single-perspective i.e. data or model-perspective) augmentation to generate positive samples, restraining the diversity of positive samples. In addition, these positive samples may be unreliable due to uncontrollable augmentation strategies that potentially alter the semantic information. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a innovative framework termed dual-perspective cross graph contrastive learning (DC-GCL), which incorporates three modifications designed to enhance positive sample diversity and reliability: 1) We propose dual-perspective augmentation strategy that provide the model with more diverse training data, enabling the model effective learning of feature consistency across different views. 2) From the data perspective, we slightly perturb the original graphs using controllable data augmentation, effectively preserving their semantic information. 3) From the model perspective, we enhance the encoder by utilizing more powerful graph transformers instead of graph neural networks. Based on the model's architecture, we propose three pruning-based strategies to slightly perturb the encoder, providing more reliable positive samples. These modifications collectively form the DC-GCL's foundation and provide more diverse and reliable training inputs, offering significant improvements over traditional GCL methods. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-GCL consistently outperforms different baselines on various datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

In many science domains such as material performance screening, while feature transformation can model material formula interactions and compositions and discover performance drivers, supervised labels are collected from expensive and lengthy experiments. This issue motivates an Unsupervised Feature Transformation Learning (UFTL) problem. Prior literature, such as manual transformation, supervised feedback guided search, and PCA, either relies on domain knowledge or expensive supervised feedback, or suffers from large search space, or overlooks non-linear feature-feature interactions. UFTL imposes a major challenge on existing methods: how to design a new unsupervised paradigm that captures complex feature interactions and avoids large search space? To fill this gap, we connect graph, contrastive, and generative learning to develop a measurement-pretrain-finetune paradigm for UFTL. For unsupervised feature set utility measurement, we propose a feature value consistency preservation perspective and develop a mean discounted cumulative gain like unsupervised metric to evaluate feature set utility. For unsupervised feature set representation pretraining, we regard a feature set as a feature-feature interaction graph, and develop an unsupervised graph contrastive learning encoder to embed feature sets into vectors. For generative transformation finetuning, we regard a feature set as a feature cross sequence and feature transformation as sequential generation. We develop a deep generative feature transformation model that coordinates the pretrained feature set encoder and the gradient information extracted from a feature set utility evaluator to optimize a transformed feature generator.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, its capacity for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we point out that the traditional optimization of InfoNCE in GCL restricts the cross-domain pairs only to be negative samples, which inevitably enlarges the distribution gap between different domains. This violates the requirement of domain invariance under OOD scenario and consequently impairs the model's OOD generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy "Negative as Positive", where the most semantically similar cross-domain negative pairs are treated as positive during GCL. Our experimental results, spanning a wide array of datasets, confirm that this method substantially improves the OOD generalization performance of GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, In Proceedings of the 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR '24), July 14-18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA</p></details> |

Despite the key principle that maximizing the similarity between positive node pairs while minimizing it between negative node pairs is well established, some fundamental problems are still unclear. Considering the complex graph structure, are some nodes consistently well-trained and following this principle even with different graph augmentations? Or are there some nodes more likely to be untrained across graph augmentations and violate the principle? How to distinguish these nodes and further guide the training of GCL? To answer these questions, we first present experimental evidence showing that the training of GCL is indeed imbalanced across all nodes. To address this problem, we propose the metric "node compactness", which is the lower bound of how a node follows the GCL principle related to the range of augmentations. We further derive the form of node compactness theoretically through bound propagation, which can be integrated into binary cross-entropy as a regularization. To this end, we propose the PrOvable Training (POT) for GCL, which regularizes the training of GCL to encode node embeddings that follows the GCL principle better. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, POT consistently improves the existing GCL approaches, serving as a friendly plugin.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 spotlight.

Doing so enables full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective unsupervised episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is model-agnostic, any existing supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task.

However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaseGNN++: Graph Contrastive Learning for Legal Case Retrieval with Graph Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11791v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a specialised information retrieval task that aims to find relevant cases to a given query case. LCR holds pivotal significance in facilitating legal practitioners in finding precedents. Most of existing LCR methods are based on traditional lexical models and language models, which have gained promising performance in retrieval. However, the domain-specific structural information inherent in legal documents is yet to be exploited to further improve the performance. Our previous work CaseGNN successfully harnesses text-attributed graphs and graph neural networks to address the problem of legal structural information neglect. Nonetheless, there remain two aspects for further investigation: (1) The underutilization of rich edge information within text-attributed case graphs limits CaseGNN to generate informative case representation. (2) The inadequacy of labelled data in legal datasets hinders the training of CaseGNN model. In this paper, CaseGNN++, which is extended from CaseGNN, is proposed to simultaneously leverage the edge information and additional label data to discover the latent potential of LCR models. Specifically, an edge feature-based graph attention layer (EUGAT) is proposed to comprehensively update node and edge features during graph modelling, resulting in a full utilisation of structural information of legal cases. Moreover, a novel graph contrastive learning objective with graph augmentation is developed in CaseGNN++ to provide additional training signals, thereby enhancing the legal comprehension capabilities of CaseGNN++ model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that CaseGNN++ not only significantly improves CaseGNN but also achieves supreme performance compared to state-of-the-art LCR methods.

To reduce this annotation burden, we develop an Image-Graph Contrastive Learning framework that pairs chest X-rays with structured report knowledge graphs automatically extracted from radiology notes. Our approach uniquely encodes the disconnected graph components via a relational graph convolution network and transformer attention. In experiments on the CheXpert dataset, this novel graph encoding strategy enabled the framework to outperform existing methods that use image-text contrastive learning in 1% linear evaluation and few-shot settings, while achieving comparable performance to radiologists. By exploiting unlabeled paired images and text, our framework demonstrates the potential of structured clinical insights to enhance contrastive learning for medical images.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on various datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Despite intensive research on deep learning approaches over a decade, there is still a significant performance gap between WSSS and full semantic segmentation. Most current WSSS methods always focus on a limited single image (pixel-wise) information while ignoring the valuable inter-image (semantic-wise) information. From this perspective, a novel end-to-end WSSS framework called DSCNet is developed along with two innovations: i) pixel-wise group contrast and semantic-wise graph contrast are proposed and introduced into the WSSS framework; ii) a novel dual-stream contrastive learning (DSCL) mechanism is designed to jointly handle pixel-wise and semantic-wise context information for better WSSS performance. Specifically, the pixel-wise group contrast learning (PGCL) and semantic-wise graph contrast learning (SGCL) tasks form a more comprehensive solution.

| **[Generative-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02810v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graphs (HGs) can effectively model complex relationships in the real world by multi-type nodes and edges. In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning, contrastive Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential by utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation is still limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators remain sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (GHGCL). Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning enhanced contrastive paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy by using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy for capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest contrastive and generative baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks. To reproduce our work, we have open-sourced our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GC-HGNN-E50C.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8figures |
| **[Community-Invariant Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01350v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph augmentation has received great attention in recent years for graph contrastive learning (GCL) to learn well-generalized node/graph representations. However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation, which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level graph information, i.e., the graph community. Moreover, current knowledge-based graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing the model to lack robustness against various types of noise. To address these limitations, this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation. Based on our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph community structure during learnable graph augmentation. By maximizing the spectral changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness. Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of our framework.

| **[Mixed Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15954v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) play a vital role in online platforms, offering users personalized suggestions amidst vast information. Graph contrastive learning aims to learn from high-order collaborative filtering signals with unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, which predominantly relies on the multi-task learning framework involving both the pair-wise recommendation loss and the contrastive loss. This decoupled design can cause inconsistent optimization direction from different losses, which leads to longer convergence time and even sub-optimal performance. Besides, the self-supervised contrastive loss falls short in alleviating the data sparsity issue in RecSys as it learns to differentiate users/items from different views without providing extra supervised collaborative filtering signals during augmentations. In this paper, we propose Mixed Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation (MixSGCL) to address these concerns. MixSGCL originally integrates the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a supervised contrastive learning loss to align the two tasks within one optimization direction. To cope with the data sparsity issue, instead unsupervised augmentation, we further propose node-wise and edge-wise mixup to mine more direct supervised collaborative filtering signals based on existing user-item interactions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MixSGCL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving top performance on both accuracy and efficiency. It validates the effectiveness of MixSGCL with our coupled design on supervised graph contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGCL: Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning For Event Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15612v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting events such as political protests, flu epidemics, and criminal activities is crucial to proactively taking necessary measures and implementing required responses to address emerging challenges. Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events. Our extensive experiment demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for event prediction on six real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Dimensional Rationale in Graph Contrastive Learning from Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10401v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning is a general learning paradigm excelling at capturing invariant information from diverse perturbations in graphs. Recent works focus on exploring the structural rationale from graphs, thereby increasing the discriminability of the invariant information. However, such methods may incur in the mis-learning of graph models towards the interpretability of graphs, and thus the learned noisy and task-agnostic information interferes with the prediction of graphs. To this end, with the purpose of exploring the intrinsic rationale of graphs, we accordingly propose to capture the dimensional rationale from graphs, which has not received sufficient attention in the literature. The conducted exploratory experiments attest to the feasibility of the aforementioned roadmap. To elucidate the innate mechanism behind the performance improvement arising from the dimensional rationale, we rethink the dimensional rationale in graph contrastive learning from a causal perspective and further formalize the causality among the variables in the pre-training stage to build the corresponding structural causal model. On the basis of the understanding of the structural causal model, we propose the dimensional rationale-aware graph contrastive learning approach, which introduces a learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network and a redundancy reduction constraint. The learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network is updated by leveraging a bi-level meta-learning technique, and the redundancy reduction constraint disentangles the redundant features through a decorrelation process during learning. Empirically, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method can yield significant performance boosts on various benchmarks with respect to discriminability and transferability. The code implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/ByronJi/DRGCL.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2024 |

Some existing methods use meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects, to construct contrastive views. However, most of them ignore the rich meta-path context information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths. Further, they fail to distinguish negative samples, which could adversely affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, which considers both meta-path contexts and weighted negative samples. Specifically, MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses meta-path contexts and characterizes details on how the objects are connected. Then, we theoretically analyze the InfoNCE loss and recognize its limitations for computing gradients of negative samples. To better distinguish negative samples, we learn hard-valued weights for them based on node clustering and use prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same cluster. In addition, we propose a variant model AdaMEOW that adaptively learns soft-valued weights of negative samples to further improve node representation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of MEOW and AdaMEOW against other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TKDE as a regular paper</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Joint Predictive Embedding and Bayesian Inference in Graph Self Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01684v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to potential implicit data leakage in our experimental setup, where the pretraining dataset was ordered by default labels, we withdraw this manuscript for further self-examination and rigorous validation</p></details> |

By engaging in pretext tasks to learn the intricate topological structures and properties of graphs using unlabeled data, these graph SSL models achieve enhanced performance, improved generalization, and heightened robustness. Despite the remarkable achievements of these graph SSL methods, their current implementation poses significant challenges for beginners and practitioners due to the complex nature of graph structures, inconsistent evaluation metrics, and concerns regarding reproducibility hinder further progress in this field. Recognizing the growing interest within the research community, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and accessible toolkit consisting of the most representative graph SSL algorithms. To address these challenges, we present a Graph SSL toolkit named PyG-SSL, which is built upon PyTorch and is compatible with various deep learning and scientific computing backends. Within the toolkit, we offer a unified framework encompassing dataset loading, hyper-parameter configuration, model training, and comprehensive performance evaluation for diverse downstream tasks. Moreover, we provide beginner-friendly tutorials and the best hyper-parameters of each graph SSL algorithm on different graph datasets, facilitating the reproduction of results.

However, the easy-to-plug-in nature of such encoders makes them vulnerable to copyright infringement. To address this issue, we develop a novel watermarking framework to protect graph encoders in GSSL settings. The key idea is to force the encoder to map a set of specially crafted trigger instances into a unique compact cluster in the outputted embedding space during model pre-training. Consequently, when the encoder is stolen and concatenated with any downstream classifiers, the resulting model inherits the `backdoor' of the encoder and predicts the trigger instances to be in a single category with high probability regardless of the ground truth. Experimental results have shown that, the embedded watermark can be transferred to various downstream tasks in black-box settings, including node classification, link prediction and community detection, which forms a reliable watermark verification system for GSSL in reality. This approach also shows satisfactory performance in terms of model fidelity, reliability and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the latest version (see highlighted content, slight different from the final version submitted to IEEE Xplore)</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Augmentation for Contrast-based Graph Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19600v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning has prominently featured an intensified exploration of spectral cues. Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph's spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that simple edge perturbations - random edge dropping for node-level and random edge adding for graph-level self-supervised learning - consistently yield comparable or superior performance while being significantly more computationally efficient. This suggests that the computational overhead of sophisticated spectral augmentations may not justify their practical benefits. Our theoretical analysis of the InfoNCE loss bounds for shallow GNNs further supports this observation. The proposed insights represent a significant leap forward in the field, potentially refining the understanding and implementation of graph self-supervised learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Learning Graph Quantized Tokenizers for Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13798v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers serve as the backbone architectures of Foundational Models, where a domain-specific tokenizer helps them adapt to various domains. Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

Over the past few years, GAEs have gained significant attention in academia and industry. In particular, the recent advent of GAEs with masked autoencoding schemes marks a significant advancement in graph self-supervised learning research. While numerous GAEs have been proposed, the underlying mechanisms of GAEs are not well understood, and a comprehensive benchmark for GAEs is still lacking. In this work, we bridge the gap between GAEs and contrastive learning by establishing conceptual and methodological connections. We revisit the GAEs studied in previous works and demonstrate how contrastive learning principles can be applied to GAEs. Motivated by these insights, we introduce lrGAE (left-right GAE), a general and powerful GAE framework that leverages contrastive learning principles to learn meaningful representations. Our proposed lrGAE not only facilitates a deeper understanding of GAEs but also sets a new benchmark for GAEs across diverse graph-based learning tasks.

The reason for its success is that a suitable SSL design can help the model to follow the neural scaling law, i.e., the performance consistently improves with increasing model and dataset sizes. However, it remains a mystery whether existing SSL in the graph domain can follow the scaling behavior toward building Graph Foundation Models~(GFMs) with large-scale pre-training. In this study, we examine whether existing graph SSL techniques can follow the neural scaling behavior with the potential to serve as the essential component for GFMs. Our benchmark includes comprehensive SSL technique implementations with analysis conducted on both the conventional SSL setting and many new settings adopted in other domains. Surprisingly, despite the SSL loss continuously decreasing, no existing graph SSL techniques follow the neural scaling behavior on the downstream performance. The model performance only merely fluctuates on different data scales and model scales. Instead of the scales, the key factors influencing the performance are the choices of model architecture and pretext task design. This paper examines existing SSL techniques for the feasibility of Graph SSL techniques in developing GFMs and opens a new direction for graph SSL design with the new evaluation prototype. Our code implementation is available online to ease reproducibility on https://github.com/GraphSSLScaling/GraphSSLScaling.</p></details> |  |

This scarcity of data can arise either due to the introduction of a new drug to the market or due to limited use in clinical settings, resulting in clinical dataset with highly unbalanced therapy representation. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel joint fusion model, which combines features from a Fully Connected (FC) Neural Network and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in a multi-modality fashion. Our model uses both tabular data about genetic sequences and a knowledge base derived from Stanford drug-resistance mutation tables, which serve as benchmark references for deducing in-vivo treatment efficacy based on the viral genetic sequence. By leveraging this knowledge base structured as a graph, the GNN component enables our model to adapt to imbalanced data distributions and account for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) drugs. We evaluated these models' robustness against OoD drugs in the test set. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model consistently outperforms the FC model. These results underscore the advantage of integrating Stanford scores in the model, thereby enhancing its generalizability and robustness, but also extending its utility in contributing in more informed clinical decisions with limited data availability.

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |

However, GCN does not perform well on sparsely-labeled graphs. Its two-layer version cannot effectively propagate the label information to the whole graph structure (i.e., the under-smoothing problem) while its deep version over-smoothens and is hard to train (i.e., the over-smoothing problem). To solve these two issues, we propose a new graph neural network called GND-Nets (for Graph Neural Diffusion Networks) that exploits the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex in a single layer. Exploiting the shallow network mitigates the over-smoothing problem while exploiting the local and global neighborhood information mitigates the under-smoothing problem. The utilization of the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex is achieved by a new graph diffusion method called neural diffusions, which integrate neural networks into the conventional linear and nonlinear graph diffusions. The adoption of neural networks makes neural diffusions adaptable to different datasets. Extensive experiments on various sparsely-labeled graphs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of GND-Nets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Accurate prediction of how drugs interact with their targets and the development of new drugs by using better methods and technologies have immense potential to speed up this process, ultimately leading to faster delivery of life-saving medications. Traditional methods used for drug-target interaction prediction show limitations, particularly in capturing complex relationships between drugs and their targets. As an outcome, deep learning models have been presented to overcome the challenges of interaction prediction through their precise and efficient end results. By outlining promising research avenues and models, each with a different solution but similar to the problem, this paper aims to give researchers a better idea of methods for even more accurate and efficient prediction of drug-target interaction, ultimately accelerating the development of more effective drugs. A total of 180 prediction methods for drug-target interactions were analyzed throughout the period spanning 2016 to 2025 using different frameworks based on machine learning, mainly deep learning and graph neural networks.

To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach, Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM), by naturally representing features in the graph structure. In particular, we design a mechanism to select the beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features. Then the proposed model, which integrates the interaction function of FM into the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by stacking layers.

Recently, the Perceiver and Perceiver IO, show competitive results for diverse dataset domains and tasks. However, recent works, Perceiver and Perceiver IO, have focused on heterogeneous modalities, including image, text, and there are few research works for graph structured datasets. A graph has an adjacency matrix different from other datasets such as text and image, and it is not trivial to handle the topological information. In this study, we provide a Graph Perceiver IO (GPIO), the Perceiver IO for the graph structured dataset. We keep the main structure of the GPIO as the Perceiver IO because the Perceiver IO already handles the diverse dataset well, except for the graph structured dataset. The GPIO is a general method that handles diverse datasets, such as graph-structured data, text, and images, by leveraging positional encoding and output query smoothing. Compared to graph neural networks (GNNs), GPIO requires lower complexity and can efficiently incorporate global and local information, which is also empirically validated through experiments. Furthermore, we propose GPIO+ for the multimodal few-shot classification that incorporates both images and graphs simultaneously. GPIO achieves higher benchmark accuracy than GNNs across multiple tasks, including graph classification, node classification, and multimodal text classification, while also attaining superior AP and AUC in link prediction. Additionally, GPIO+ outperforms GNNs in multimodal few-shot classification. Our GPIO(+) can serve as a general architecture for handling various modalities and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

| **[GNN-Coder: Boosting Semantic Code Retrieval with Combined GNNs and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15202v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code retrieval is a crucial component in modern software development, particularly in large-scale projects. However, existing approaches relying on sequence-based models often fail to fully exploit the structural dependencies inherent in code, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance, particularly with structurally complex code fragments. In this paper, we introduce GNN-Coder, a novel framework based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) to utilize Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). We make the first attempt to study how GNN-integrated Transformer can promote the development of semantic retrieval tasks by capturing the structural and semantic features of code. We further propose an innovative graph pooling method tailored for AST, utilizing the number of child nodes as a key feature to highlight the intrinsic topological relationships within the AST. This design effectively integrates both sequential and hierarchical representations, enhancing the model's ability to capture code structure and semantics. Additionally, we introduce the Mean Angular Margin (MAM), a novel metric for quantifying the uniformity of code embedding distributions, providing a standardized measure of feature separability. The proposed method achieves a lower MAM, indicating a more discriminative feature representation. This underscores GNN-Coder's superior ability to distinguish between code snippets, thereby enhancing retrieval accuracy. Experimental results show that GNN-Coder significantly boosts retrieval performance, with a 1\%-10\% improvement in MRR on the CSN dataset, and a notable 20\% gain in zero-shot performance on the CosQA dataset.</p></details> |  |

But accurate prediction remains challenging with traditional methods, especially with diverse patient populations. This study developed a deep learning-based graph neural network (GNN) model to predict seizure freedom from stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) data in patients with refractory epilepsy. We utilized high-quality sEEG data from 15 pediatric patients to train a deep learning model that can accurately predict seizure freedom outcomes and advance understanding of brain connectivity at the seizure onset zone. Our model integrates local and global connectivity using graph convolutions with multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture connections between difficult-to-study regions such as the thalamus and motor regions. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in binary class analysis, 86.6% in patient-wise analysis, and 81.4% in multi-class analysis. Node and edge-level feature analysis highlighted the anterior cingulate and frontal pole regions as key contributors to seizure freedom outcomes. The nodes identified by our model were also more likely to coincide with seizure onset zones. Our findings underscore the potential of new connectivity-based deep learning models such as GNNs for enhancing the prediction of seizure freedom, predicting seizure onset zones, connectivity analysis of the brain during seizure, as well as informing AI-assisted personalized epilepsy treatment planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Nodes Can Help: Tackling Distribution Shifts in Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19229v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to jointly train powerful graph learning models, e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), without sharing their local graph data for graph-related downstream tasks, such as graph property prediction. In the real world, however, the graph data can suffer from significant distribution shifts across clients as the clients may collect their graph data for different purposes. In particular, graph properties are usually associated with invariant label-relevant substructures (i.e., subgraphs) across clients, while label-irrelevant substructures can appear in a client-specific manner. The issue of distribution shifts of graph data hinders the efficiency of GNN training and leads to serious performance degradation in FGL. To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel FGL framework entitled FedVN that eliminates distribution shifts through client-specific graph augmentation strategies with multiple learnable Virtual Nodes (VNs). Specifically, FedVN lets the clients jointly learn a set of shared VNs while training a global GNN model. To eliminate distribution shifts, each client trains a personalized edge generator that determines how the VNs connect local graphs in a client-specific manner. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses indicating that FedVN can eliminate distribution shifts of graph data across clients. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets under five settings demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FedVN over nine baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

GNNs enable differentiable end-to-end (E2E) learning of model parameters given graph structure which enables optimization towards popular node, edge (link) and graph-level tasks. While the research innovation in new GNN layers and training strategies has been rapid, industrial adoption and utility of GNNs has lagged considerably due to the unique scale challenges that large-scale graph ML problems create. In this work, we share our approach to training, inference, and utilization of GNNs at Snapchat. To this end, we present GiGL (Gigantic Graph Learning), an open-source library to enable large-scale distributed graph ML to the benefit of researchers, ML engineers, and practitioners. We use GiGL internally at Snapchat to manage the heavy lifting of GNN workflows, including graph data preprocessing from relational DBs, subgraph sampling, distributed training, inference, and orchestration. GiGL is designed to interface cleanly with open-source GNN modeling libraries prominent in academia like PyTorch Geometric (PyG), while handling scaling and productionization challenges that make it easier for internal practitioners to focus on modeling. GiGL is used in multiple production settings, and has powered over 35 launches across multiple business domains in the last 2 years in the contexts of friend recommendation, content recommendation and advertising. This work details high-level design and tools the library provides, scaling properties, case studies in diverse business settings with industry-scale graphs, and several key lessons learned in employing graph ML at scale on large social data.

| **[Benchmarking Android Malware Detection: Rethinking the Role of Traditional and Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15041v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection has been extensively studied using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. While many state-of-the-art detection models, particularly those based on DL, claim superior performance, they often rely on limited comparisons, lacking comprehensive benchmarking against traditional ML models across diverse datasets. This raises concerns about the robustness of DL-based approaches' performance and the potential oversight of simpler, more efficient ML models. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Android malware detection models across four datasets: three recently published, publicly available datasets and a large-scale dataset we systematically collected. We implement a range of traditional ML models, including Random Forests (RF) and CatBoost, alongside advanced DL models such as Capsule Graph Neural Networks (CapsGNN), BERT-based models, and ExcelFormer based models. Our results reveal that while advanced DL models can achieve strong performance, they are often compared against an insufficient number of traditional ML baselines. In many cases, simpler and more computationally efficient ML models achieve comparable or even superior performance. These findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking in Android malware detection research. We encourage future studies to conduct more comprehensive benchmarking comparisons between traditional and advanced models to ensure a more accurate assessment of detection capabilities. To facilitate further research, we provide access to our dataset, including app IDs, hash values, and labels.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding the Design Principles of Link Prediction in Directed Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15008v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a widely studied task in Graph Representation Learning (GRL) for modeling relational data. The early theories in GRL were based on the assumption of a symmetric adjacency matrix, reflecting an undirected setting. As a result, much of the following state-of-the-art research has continued to operate under this symmetry assumption, even though real-world data often involve crucial information conveyed through the direction of relationships. This oversight limits the ability of these models to fully capture the complexity of directed interactions. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of directed link prediction by evaluating key heuristics that have been successful in undirected settings. We propose simple but effective adaptations of these heuristics to the directed link prediction task and demonstrate that these modifications produce competitive performance compared to the leading Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) originally designed for undirected graphs. Through an extensive set of experiments, we derive insights that inform the development of a novel framework for directed link prediction, which not only surpasses baseline methods but also outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

| **[Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11782v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, The German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR) 2024</p></details> |

Unlike typical GNN methods that treat each traffic sensor as an individual graph node, DeepStateGNN clusters sensors into higher-level graph nodes, dubbed Deep State Nodes, based on various similarity criteria, resulting in a fixed number of nodes in a Deep State graph. The term "Deep State" nodes is a play on words, referencing hidden networks of power that, like these nodes, secretly govern traffic independently of visible sensors. These Deep State Nodes are defined by several similarity factors, including spatial proximity (e.g., sensors located nearby in the road network), functional similarity (e.g., sensors on similar types of freeways), and behavioral similarity under specific conditions (e.g., traffic behavior during rain). This clustering approach allows for dynamic and adaptive node grouping, as sensors can belong to multiple clusters and clusters may evolve over time. Our experimental results show that DeepStateGNN offers superior scalability and faster training, while also delivering more accurate results than competitors. It effectively handles large-scale sensor networks, outperforming other methods in both traffic forecasting and reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Yanni...</summary><p>Yannick W\"olker and Arash Hajisafi contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (2025)</p></details> |

However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work presents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance faithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE and generated text.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently enabled Deep Graph Clustering (DGC) methods to learn cluster assignments from semantic and topological information. However, their success depends on the prior knowledge related to the number of communities $K$, which is unrealistic due to the high costs and privacy issues of acquisition.In this paper, we investigate the community detection problem without prior $K$, referred to as $K$-Free Community Detection problem. To address this problem, we propose a novel Deep Adaptive and Generative model~(DAG) for community detection without specifying the prior $K$. DAG consists of three key components, \textit{i.e.,} a node representation learning module with masked attribute reconstruction, a community affiliation readout module, and a community number search module with group sparsity. These components enable DAG to convert the process of non-differentiable grid search for the community number, \textit{i.e.,} a discrete hyperparameter in existing DGC methods, into a differentiable learning process. In such a way, DAG can simultaneously perform community detection and community number search end-to-end. To alleviate the cost of acquiring community labels in real-world applications, we design a new metric, EDGE, to evaluate community detection methods even when the labels are not feasible. Extensive offline experiments on five public datasets and a real-world online mobile game dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DAG over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DAG has a relative increase of 7.35\% in teams in a Tencent online game compared with the best competitor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024</p></details> |

Our method introduces an innovative graph representation where timestamps are modeled as distinct nodes, allowing temporal dependencies to be explicitly captured through graph edges. This setup is extended to construct a multi-ship graph that effectively captures spatial interactions while preserving graph sparsity.

Recent research has sought to alleviate this issue by simultaneously leveraging graph learning and meta-learning paradigms. However, these graph meta-learning models assume the availability of numerous meta-training tasks to learn transferable meta-knowledge. Such assumption may not be feasible in the real world due to the difficulty of constructing tasks and the substantial costs involved. Therefore, we propose a SiMple yet effectIve approach for graph few-shot Learning with fEwer tasks, named SMILE. We introduce a dual-level mixup strategy, encompassing both within-task and across-task mixup, to simultaneously enrich the available nodes and tasks in meta-learning. Moreover, we explicitly leverage the prior information provided by the node degrees in the graph to encode expressive node representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SMILE can enhance the model generalization ability. Empirically, SMILE consistently outperforms other competitive models by a large margin across all evaluated datasets with in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Hardware Trojans can give rise to diverse attack vectors such as information leakage (e.g. MOLES Trojan) and denial-of-service (rarely triggered bit flip). Such an attack in critical systems (e.g. healthcare and aviation) can endanger human lives and lead to catastrophic financial loss. Several techniques have been developed to detect such malicious modifications in digital designs, particularly for designs sourced from third-party intellectual property (IP) vendors. However, most techniques have scalability concerns (due to unsound assumptions during evaluation) and lead to large number of false positive detections (false alerts). Our framework (SALTY) mitigates these concerns through the use of a novel Graph Neural Network architecture (using Jumping-Knowledge mechanism) for generating initial predictions and an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach for fine tuning the outcomes (post-processing). Experiments show 98% True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across a large set of standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel data-driven formulation of the problem. We use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the adoption of products by utilizing both topological and attribute information. The resulting Dynamic Viral Marketing (DVM) problem seeks to find the minimum budget and minimal set of dynamic topological and attribute changes in order to attain a specified adoption goal. We show that DVM is NP-Hard and is related to the existing influence maximization problem. Motivated by this connection, we develop the idea of Dynamic Gradient Influencing (DGI) that uses gradient ranking to find optimal perturbations and targets low-budget and high influence non-adopters in discrete steps. We use an efficient strategy for computing node budgets and develop the ''Meta-Influence'' heuristic for assessing a node's downstream influence. We evaluate DGI against multiple baselines and demonstrate gains on average of 24% on budget and 37% on AUC on real-world attributed networks.

In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms either use graph neural networks to model sessions in a graph or leverage the similarity of sessions by exploiting item features. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and propose a novel method, Graph Convolutional Network Extension (GCNext), which incorporates item features directly into the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. GCNext creates a feature-rich item co-occurrence graph and learns the corresponding item embeddings in an unsupervised manner. We show on three datasets that integrating GCNext into sequential recommendation algorithms significantly boosts the performance of nearest-neighbor methods as well as neural network models. Our flexible extension is easy to incorporate in state-of-the-art methods and increases the MRR@20 by up to 12.79%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets.

| **[Homophily Heterogeneity Matters in Graph Federated Learning: A Spectrum Sharing and Complementing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13732v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since heterogeneity presents a fundamental challenge in graph federated learning, many existing methods are proposed to deal with node feature heterogeneity and structure heterogeneity. However, they overlook the critical homophily heterogeneity, which refers to the substantial variation in homophily levels across graph data from different clients. The homophily level represents the proportion of edges connecting nodes that belong to the same class. Due to adapting to their local homophily, local models capture inconsistent spectral properties across different clients, significantly reducing the effectiveness of collaboration. Specifically, local models trained on graphs with high homophily tend to capture low-frequency information, whereas local models trained on graphs with low homophily tend to capture high-frequency information. To effectively deal with homophily heterophily, we introduce the spectral Graph Neural Network (GNN) and propose a novel Federated learning method by mining Graph Spectral Properties (FedGSP). On one hand, our proposed FedGSP enables clients to share generic spectral properties (i.e., low-frequency information), allowing all clients to benefit through collaboration. On the other hand, inspired by our theoretical findings, our proposed FedGSP allows clients to complement non-generic spectral properties by acquiring the spectral properties they lack (i.e., high-frequency information), thereby obtaining additional information gain. Extensive experiments conducted on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets, across both non-overlapping and overlapping settings, validate the superiority of our method over eleven state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our FedGSP outperforms the second-best method by an average margin of 3.28% on all heterophilic datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Towards Invariance to Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13660v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to have limited expressive power, due to their message passing structure. One mechanism for circumventing this limitation is to add unique node identifiers (IDs), which break the symmetries that underlie the expressivity limitation. In this work, we highlight a key limitation of the ID framework, and propose an approach for addressing it. We begin by observing that the final output of the GNN should clearly not depend on the specific IDs used. We then show that in practice this does not hold, and thus the learned network does not possess this desired structural property. Such invariance to node IDs may be enforced in several ways, and we discuss their theoretical properties. We then propose a novel regularization method that effectively enforces ID invariance to the network. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves ID invariance and, in turn, often boosts generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.02271</p></details> |

However, their massive computational demands and lack of interpretability pose challenges for real-world applications requiring efficiency and transparency. In this work, we explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives for Environmental Claim Detection, reframing it as a graph classification problem. We construct dependency parsing graphs to explicitly model syntactic structures, using simple word embeddings (word2vec) for node features with dependency relations encoded as edge features. Our results demonstrate that these graph-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art transformers while using 30x fewer parameters. This efficiency highlights the potential of structured, interpretable, and computationally efficient graph-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models In-Context Graph Learners?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13562v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context reasoning capabilities across a wide range of tasks, particularly with unstructured inputs such as language or images. However, LLMs struggle to handle structured data, such as graphs, due to their lack of understanding of non-Euclidean structures. As a result, without additional fine-tuning, their performance significantly lags behind that of graph neural networks (GNNs) in graph learning tasks. In this paper, we show that learning on graph data can be conceptualized as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process, where specific instances (e.g., nodes or edges) act as queries, and the graph itself serves as the retrieved context. Building on this insight, we propose a series of RAG frameworks to enhance the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs for graph learning tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed RAG frameworks significantly improve LLM performance on graph-based tasks, particularly in scenarios where a pretrained LLM must be used without modification or accessed via an API.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Graph Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12618v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a prominent approach for learning from graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness can be significantly compromised when the graph structure is suboptimal. To address this issue, Graph Structure Learning (GSL) has emerged as a promising technique that refines node connections adaptively. Nevertheless, we identify two key limitations in existing GSL methods: 1) Most methods primarily focus on node similarity to construct relationships, while overlooking the quality of node information. Blindly connecting low-quality nodes and aggregating their ambiguous information can degrade the performance of other nodes. 2) The constructed graph structures are often constrained to be symmetric, which may limit the model's flexibility and effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Graph Structure Learning (UnGSL) strategy. UnGSL estimates the uncertainty of node information and utilizes it to adjust the strength of directional connections, where the influence of nodes with high uncertainty is adaptively reduced. Importantly, UnGSL serves as a plug-in module that can be seamlessly integrated into existing GSL methods with minimal additional computational cost. In our experiments, we implement UnGSL into six representative GSL methods, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TheWebConf 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on pairwise interactions and investigate their importance in constructing feature graphs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Rather than proposing new methods, we leverage existing GNN models and tools to explore the relationship between feature graph structures and their effectiveness in modeling interactions. Through experiments on synthesized datasets, we uncover that edges between interacting features are important for enabling GNNs to model feature interactions effectively. We also observe that including non-interaction edges can act as noise, degrading model performance. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support for sparse feature graph selection using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We prove that feature graphs retaining only necessary interaction edges yield a more efficient and interpretable representation than complete graphs, aligning with Occam's Razor. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing feature graphs that improve the performance and interpretability of GNN models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the draft before submitting to any journal</p></details> |
| **[Large Language-Geometry Model: When LLM meets Equivariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11149v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting 3D structures and dynamics of physical systems is crucial in scientific applications. Existing approaches that rely on geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively enforce $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance, but they often fall in leveraging extensive broader information. While direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs) can incorporate external knowledge, they lack the capability for spatial reasoning with guaranteed equivariance. In this paper, we propose EquiLLM, a novel framework for representing 3D physical systems that seamlessly integrates E(3)-equivariance with LLM capabilities. Specifically, EquiLLM comprises four key components: geometry-aware prompting, an equivariant encoder, an LLM, and an equivariant adaptor. Essentially, the LLM guided by the instructive prompt serves as a sophisticated invariant feature processor, while 3D directional information is exclusively handled by the equivariant encoder and adaptor modules. Experimental results demonstrate that EquiLLM delivers significant improvements over previous methods across molecular dynamics simulation, human motion simulation, and antibody design, highlighting its promising generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the database (DB) community has increasingly recognized the potentiality of GNNs, prompting a surge of researches focusing on improving database systems through GNN-based approaches. However, despite notable advances, There is a lack of a comprehensive review and understanding of how GNNs could improve DB systems. Therefore, this survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured and in-depth overview of GNNs for DB systems. Specifically, we propose a new taxonomy that classifies existing methods into two key categories: (1) Relational Databases, which includes tasks like performance prediction, query optimization, and text-to-SQL, and (2) Graph Databases, addressing challenges like efficient graph query processing and graph similarity computation. We systematically review key methods in each category, highlighting their contributions and practical implications.

This work proposes \ourtool, a novel way to generate context using guidance from graph neural networks (GNNs) to generate efficient parallel codes. We evaluate \ourtool \xspace{} on $12$ applications from two well-known benchmark suites of parallel codes: NAS Parallel Benchmark and Rodinia Benchmark. Our results show that \ourtool \xspace{} improves the state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) by 19.9\% in NAS and 6.48\% in Rodinia benchmark in terms of CodeBERTScore for the task of parallel code generation. Moreover, \ourtool \xspace{} improves the ability of the most powerful LLM to date, GPT-4, by achieving $\approx$17\% (on NAS benchmark) and $\approx$16\% (on Rodinia benchmark) better speedup. In addition, we propose \ourscore \xspace{} for evaluating the quality of the parallel code and show its effectiveness in evaluating parallel codes. \ourtool \xspace is available at https://github.com/quazirafi/AutoParLLM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[K-Paths: Reasoning over Graph Paths for Drug Repurposing and Drug Interaction Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13344v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery is a complex and time-intensive process that requires identifying and validating new therapeutic candidates. Computational approaches using large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution to accelerate this process. However, extracting meaningful insights from large-scale KGs remains challenging due to the complexity of graph traversal. Existing subgraph-based methods are tailored to graph neural networks (GNNs), making them incompatible with other models, such as large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful paths from KGs. Integrating these paths enables LLMs and GNNs to effectively predict unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Unlike traditional path-ranking approaches, K-Paths retrieves and transforms paths into a structured format that LLMs can directly process, facilitating explainable reasoning. K-Paths employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to retrieve the K shortest loopless paths between entities in an interaction query, prioritizing biologically relevant and diverse relationships. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves the zero-shot performance of Llama 8.1B's F1-score by 12.45 points on drug repurposing and 13.42 points on interaction severity prediction. We also show that Llama 70B achieves F1-score gains of 6.18 and 8.46 points, respectively. K-Paths also improves the supervised training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing KG size by 90% while maintaining strong predictive performance. Beyond its scalability and efficiency, K-Paths uniquely bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, providing explainable rationales for predicted interactions. These capabilities show that K-Paths is a valuable tool for efficient data-driven drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</p></details> |  |

A large number of classical as well as modern deep learning based algorithms have been proposed for this problem, often having tunable hyperparameters. We initiate a formal study of tuning algorithm hyperparameters from parameterized algorithm families for this problem. We obtain novel $O(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension upper bounds for hyperparameter selection in three classical label propagation-based algorithm families, where $n$ is the number of nodes, implying bounds on the amount of data needed for learning provably good parameters. We further provide matching $\Omega(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension lower bounds, thus asymptotically characterizing the learning-theoretic complexity of the parameter tuning problem. We extend our study to selecting architectural hyperparameters in modern graph neural networks. We bound the Rademacher complexity for tuning the self-loop weighting in recently proposed Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) networks. We further propose a tunable architecture that interpolates graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in every layer, and provide Rademacher complexity bounds for tuning the interpolation coefficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (11 pages main body), 2 figures</p></details> |

However, IGNNs rely on computationally expensive fixed-point iterations, which lead to significant speed and scalability limitations, hindering their application to large-scale graphs. To achieve fast fixed-point solving for IGNNs, we propose a novel graph neural solver, IGNN-Solver, which leverages the generalized Anderson Acceleration method, parameterized by a tiny GNN, and learns iterative updates as a graph-dependent temporal process. To improve effectiveness on large-scale graph tasks, we further integrate sparsification and storage compression methods, specifically tailored for the IGNN-Solver, into its design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IGNN-Solver significantly accelerates inference on both small- and large-scale tasks, achieving a $1.5\times$ to $8\times$ speedup without sacrificing accuracy. This advantage becomes more pronounced as the graph scale grows, facilitating its large-scale deployment in real-world applications. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/landrarwolf/IGNN-Solver.</p></details> |  |

However, because of the rapid increase in network devices and services, it has become crucial to have targeted access to detailed network information in a dynamic network environment. This paper proposes an intelligent network telemetry system called NTP-INT to obtain more fine-grained network information on high-load switches. Specifically, NTP-INT consists of three modules: network traffic prediction module, network pruning module, and probe path planning module. Firstly, the network traffic prediction module adopts a Multi-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MTGNN) to predict future network traffic and identify high-load switches. Then, we design the network pruning algorithm to generate a subnetwork covering all high-load switches to reduce the complexity of probe path planning. Finally, the probe path planning module uses an attention-mechanism-based deep reinforcement learning (DEL) model to plan efficient probe paths in the network slice. The experimental results demonstrate that NTP-INT can acquire more precise network information on high-load switches while decreasing the control overhead by 50\%.</p></details> |  |

Current fraud detection methods, whether employing graph neural networks or sequence models, fail to consider the semantic information and similarity patterns within transactions. Moreover, these approaches do not leverage the potential synergistic benefits of combining both types of models. To address these challenges, we propose TLMG4Eth that combines a transaction language model with graph-based methods to capture semantic, similarity, and structural features of transaction data in Ethereum. We first propose a transaction language model that converts numerical transaction data into meaningful transaction sentences, enabling the model to learn explicit transaction semantics. Then, we propose a transaction attribute similarity graph to learn transaction similarity information, enabling us to capture intuitive insights into transaction anomalies. Additionally, we construct an account interaction graph to capture the structural information of the account transaction network. We employ a deep multi-head attention network to fuse transaction semantic and similarity embeddings, and ultimately propose a joint training approach for the multi-head attention network and the account interaction graph to obtain the synergistic benefits of both.</p></details> |  |

Circuits can be formulated as And-Inverter graphs (AIGs), enabling efficient implementation of representation learning through graph neural networks (GNNs). Masked modeling paradigms have been proven effective in graph representation learning. However, masking augmentation to original circuits will destroy their logical equivalence, which is unsuitable for circuit representation learning. Moreover, existing masked modeling paradigms often prioritize structural information at the expense of abstract information such as circuit function. To address these limitations, we introduce MGVGA, a novel constrained masked modeling paradigm incorporating masked gate modeling (MGM) and Verilog-AIG alignment (VGA). Specifically, MGM preserves logical equivalence by masking gates in the latent space rather than in the original circuits, subsequently reconstructing the attributes of these masked gates. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of the Verilog code functionality. Building upon this capability, VGA performs masking operations on original circuits and reconstructs masked gates under the constraints of equivalent Verilog codes, enabling GNNs to learn circuit functions from LLMs. We evaluate MGVGA on various logic synthesis tasks for EDA and show the superior performance of MGVGA compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95 reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38 higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework combining graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the aircraft landing problem.

While mode connectivity, a lens for analyzing geometric properties of loss landscapes has proven insightful for other deep learning architectures, its implications for GNNs remain unexplored. This work presents the first investigation of mode connectivity in GNNs. We uncover that GNNs exhibit distinct non-linear mode connectivity, diverging from patterns observed in fully-connected networks or CNNs. Crucially, we demonstrate that graph structure, rather than model architecture, dominates this behavior, with graph properties like homophily correlating with mode connectivity patterns. We further establish a link between mode connectivity and generalization, proposing a generalization bound based on loss barriers and revealing its utility as a diagnostic tool. Our findings further bridge theoretical insights with practical implications: they rationalize domain alignment strategies in graph learning and provide a foundation for refining GNN training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

This method processes the input image into a series of small patches. However, because of the strong correlation between different facial components in facial images. When it comes to super-resolution of low-resolution images, existing algorithms cannot handle the relationships between patches well, resulting in distorted facial components in the super-resolution results. To solve the problem, we propose a transformer architecture based on graph neural networks called graph vision transformer network. We treat each patch as a graph node and establish an adjacency matrix based on the information between patches. In this way, the patch only interacts between neighboring patches, further processing the relationship of facial components. Quantitative and visualization experiments have underscored the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques. Through detailed comparisons, we have demonstrated that our algorithm possesses more advanced super-resolution capabilities, particularly in enhancing facial components.

However, even such models provide high accuracy in energy and force Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over trained (in-distribution) datasets, they often become unstable during long-time MD simulation when used for out-of-distribution datasets. In this paper, we propose a feature correlation based method for GNNFF models to enhance the stability of MD simulation. We reveal the negative relationship between feature correlation and the stability of GNNFF models, and design a loss function with a dynamic loss coefficient scheduler to reduce edge feature correlation that can be applied in general GNNFF training. We also propose an empirical metric to evaluate the stability in MD simulation. Experiments show our method can significantly improve stability for GNNFF models especially in out-of-distribution data with less than 3% computational overhead. For example, we can ensure the stable MD simulation time from 0.03ps to 10ps for Allegro model.</p></details> |  |

Ultrasound imaging, a widely used and cost-effective medical diagnostic procedure, faces challenges due to the global shortage of professional sonographers. To address this issue, we propose USPilot, an embodied robotic assistant ultrasound system powered by an LLM-based framework to enable autonomous ultrasound acquisition.

By fine-tuning the LLM, USPilot demonstrates a deep understanding of ultrasound-specific questions and tasks. Furthermore, USPilot incorporates an LLM-enhanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) to manage ultrasound robotic APIs and serve as a task planner. Experimental results show that the LLM-enhanced GNN achieves unprecedented accuracy in task planning on public datasets. Additionally, the system demonstrates significant potential in autonomously understanding and executing ultrasound procedures. These advancements bring us closer to achieving autonomous and potentially unmanned robotic ultrasound systems, addressing critical resource gaps in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Among existing studies, certified graph unlearning is distinguished by providing robust privacy guarantees. However, current certified graph unlearning methods are impractical for large-scale graphs because they necessitate the costly re-computation of graph propagation for each unlearning request. Although numerous scalable techniques have been developed to accelerate graph propagation for GNNs, their integration into certified graph unlearning remains uncertain as these scalable approaches introduce approximation errors into node embeddings. In contrast, certified graph unlearning demands bounded model error on exact node embeddings to maintain its certified guarantee. To address this challenge, we present ScaleGUN, the first approach to scale certified graph unlearning to billion-edge graphs. ScaleGUN integrates the approximate graph propagation technique into certified graph unlearning, offering certified guarantees for three unlearning scenarios: node feature, edge, and node unlearning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and unlearning efficacy of ScaleGUN.

Recently, CE for queries over knowlege graph (KGs) with triple facts has achieved great success. To more precisely represent facts, current researchers propose hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) to represent a triple fact with qualifiers providing additional context to the fact. However, existing CE methods, such as sampling and summary methods over KGs, perform unsatisfactorily on HKGs due to the complexity of qualifiers. Learning-based CE methods do not utilize qualifier information to learn query representation accurately, leading to poor performance. Also, there is only one limited CE benchmark for HKG query, which is not comprehensive and only covers limited patterns. The lack of querysets over HKG also becomes a bottleneck to comprehensively investigate CE problems on HKGs. In this work, we first construct diverse and unbiased hyper-relational querysets over three popular HKGs for investigating CE. Besides, we also propose a novel qualifier-aware graph neural network (GNN) model that effectively incorporates qualifier information and adaptively combines outputs from multiple GNN layers, to accurately predict the cardinality. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art CE methods over three benchmarks on popular HKGs.</p></details> |  |

Attention Graphs aggregate attention matrices across Transformer layers and heads to describe how information flows among input nodes. Through experiments on homophilous and heterophilous node classification tasks, we analyze Attention Graphs from a network science perspective and find that: (1) When Graph Transformers are allowed to learn the optimal graph structure using all-to-all attention among input nodes, the Attention Graphs learned by the model do not tend to correlate with the input/original graph structure; and (2) For heterophilous graphs, different Graph Transformer variants can achieve similar performance while utilising distinct information flow patterns.

However, computational fluid dynamics simulations remain relatively costly in a clinical context. Moreover, projection-based reduced-order models and purely data-driven surrogate models struggle due to the high variability of anatomical shapes in a population. A possible solution is shape registration: a reference template geometry is designed from a cohort of available geometries, which can then be diffeomorphically mapped onto it. This provides a natural encoding that can be exploited by machine learning architectures and, at the same time, a reference computational domain in which efficient dimension-reduction strategies can be performed. We compare state-of-the-art graph neural network models with recent data assimilation strategies for the prediction of physical quantities and clinically relevant biomarkers in the context of aortic coarctation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Surrogates for Optimizing Transportation Policies with Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11057v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper presents a first approach of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as surrogates for large-scale agent-based simulation models. In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Networks for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11624v4)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences. Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation learner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our \model surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06% and 12.15% on average across all datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10 respectively.</p></details> |  |

Opinion dynamics provide interpretability for studying opinion evolution, yet incorporating these insights into predictive models remains challenging. This challenge arises due to the inherent complexity of the diversity of opinion fusion rules and the difficulty in capturing equilibrium states while avoiding over-smoothing. This paper constructs a unified opinion dynamics model to integrate different opinion fusion rules and generates corresponding synthetic datasets. To fully leverage the advantages of unified opinion dynamics, we introduces UniGO, a framework for modeling opinion evolution on graphs. Using a coarsen-refine mechanism, UniGO efficiently models opinion dynamics through a graph neural network, mitigating over-smoothing while preserving equilibrium phenomena. UniGO leverages pretraining on synthetic datasets, which enhances its ability to generalize to real-world scenarios, providing a viable paradigm for applications of opinion dynamics. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate UniGO's effectiveness in capturing complex opinion formation processes and predicting future evolution. The pretrained model also shows strong generalization capability, validating the benefits of using synthetic data to boost real-world performance.</p></details> | WWW2025 |

Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classification in multiclass settings. Digital twins of 5G networks increasingly employ graph classification as the main method for identifying failure types. However, the skewed distribution of failure occurrences is a major class imbalance issue that prevents effective graph data mining. Previous studies have not sufficiently tackled this complex problem. In this paper, we propose Class-Fourier Graph Neural Network (CF-GNN) introduces a class-oriented spectral filtering mechanism that ensures precise classification by estimating a unique spectral filter for each class. We employ eigenvalue and eigenvector spectral filtering to capture and adapt to variations in the minority classes, ensuring accurate class-specific feature discrimination, and adept at graph representation learning for complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed CF-GNN could help with both the creation of new techniques for enhancing classifiers and the investigation of the characteristics of the multi-class imbalanced data in a network digital twin system.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.06595</p></details> |
| **[PHLP: Sole Persistent Homology for Link Prediction - Interpretable Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15225v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction (LP), inferring the connectivity between nodes, is a significant research area in graph data, where a link represents essential information on relationships between nodes. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based models have achieved high performance in LP, understanding why they perform well is challenging because most comprise complex neural networks. We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to interpret the features used for prediction. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</p></details> |  |

Numerous solutions have been proposed to discover SHSs that generally require high run time on large-scale networks. Another challenge is discovering SHSs across different types of networks for which the traditional one-model-fit-all approach fails to capture the inter-graph difference, particularly in the case of diverse networks. Therefore, there is an urgent need of developing effective solutions for discovering SHSs in large-scale and diverse networks. Inspired by the recent advancement of graph neural network approaches on various graph problems, we propose graph neural network-based models to discover SHS nodes in large scale networks and diverse networks. We transform the problem into a learning problem and propose an efficient model GraphSHS, that exploits both the network structure and node features to discover SHS nodes in large scale networks, endeavouring to lessen the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. To effectively discover SHSs across diverse networks, we propose another model Meta-GraphSHS based on meta-learning that learns generalizable knowledge from diverse training graphs (instead of directly learning the model) and utilizes the learned knowledge to create a customized model to identify SHSs in each new graph. We theoretically show that the depth of the proposed graph neural network model should be at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ to accurately calculate the SHSs discovery problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed models through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results show that GraphSHS discovers SHSs with high accuracy and is at least 167.1 times faster than the comparative methods on large-scale real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

While these CDCL solvers only operate on a per-problem basis, graph neural network (GNN) based solvers bring new benefits to the field by allowing practitioners to exploit knowledge gained from solved problems to expedite solving of new SAT problems. However, one specific area that is often studied in the context of CDCL solvers, but largely overlooked in GNN solvers, is the relationship between graph theoretic measure of structure in SAT problems and the generalisation ability of GNN solvers. To bridge the gap between structural graph properties (e.g., modularity, self-similarity) and the generalisability (or lack thereof) of GNN based SAT solvers, we present StructureSAT: a curated dataset, along with code to further generate novel examples, containing a diverse set of SAT problems from well known problem domains. Furthermore, we utilise a novel splitting method that focuses on deconstructing the families into more detailed hierarchies based on their structural properties. With the new dataset, we aim to help explain problematic generalisation in existing GNN SAT solvers by exploiting knowledge of structural graph properties. We conclude with multiple future directions that can help researchers in GNN based SAT solving develop more effective and generalisable SAT solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025</p></details> |

These nodes are called Structural Hole Spanners (SHS). SHSs have many applications, including viral marketing, information dissemination, community detection, etc. Numerous solutions are proposed to discover SHSs; however, most of the solutions are only applicable to static networks. Since real-world networks are dynamic networks; consequently, in this study, we aim to discover SHSs in dynamic networks. Discovering SHSs is an NP-hard problem, due to which, instead of discovering exact k SHSs, we adopt a greedy approach to discover top-k SHSs. Motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we design a Graph Neural Network-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to reduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed model through exhaustive experiments, and our results show that the proposed GNN-SHS model is at least 31.8 times faster and, on an average 671.6 times faster than the comparative method, providing a considerable efficiency advantage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oversmoothing as Loss of Sign: Towards Structural Balance in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11394v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a common issue in graph neural networks (GNNs), where node representations become excessively homogeneous as the number of layers increases, resulting in degraded performance. Various strategies have been proposed to combat oversmoothing in practice, yet they are based on different heuristics and lack a unified understanding of their inherent mechanisms. In this paper, we show that three major classes of anti-oversmoothing techniques can be mathematically interpreted as message passing over signed graphs comprising both positive and negative edges. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of signed graph propagation, we demonstrate that negative edges can repel nodes to a certain extent, providing deeper insights into how these methods mitigate oversmoothing. Furthermore, our results suggest that the structural balance of a signed graph-where positive edges exist only within clusters and negative edges appear only between clusters-is crucial for clustering node representations in the long term through signed graph propagation. Motivated by these observations, we propose a solution to mitigate oversmoothing with theoretical guarantees-Structural Balance Propagation (SBP), by incorporating label and feature information to create a structurally balanced graph for message-passing. Experiments on nine datasets against twelve baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting the value of our signed graph perspective.</p></details> |  |

Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Topic Modeling with Topic Tree-based Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11345v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual documents are commonly connected in a hierarchical graph structure where a central document links to others with an exponentially growing connectivity. Though Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing such graph hierarchy, they cannot model the rich textual semantics within documents. Moreover, text contents in documents usually discuss topics of different specificity. Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs) discover such latent topic hierarchy within text corpora. However, most of them focus on the textual content within documents, and ignore the graph adjacency across interlinked documents. We thus propose a Hierarchical Graph Topic Modeling Transformer to integrate both topic hierarchy within documents and graph hierarchy across documents into a unified Transformer. Specifically, to incorporate topic hierarchy within documents, we design a topic tree and infer a hierarchical tree embedding for hierarchical topic modeling. To preserve both topic and graph hierarchies, we design our model in hyperbolic space and propose Hyperbolic Doubly Recurrent Neural Network, which models ancestral and fraternal tree structure. Both hierarchies are inserted into each Transformer layer to learn unified representations. Both supervised and unsupervised experiments verify the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> |  |

Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics.

However, as these systems become increasingly integrated into critical applications, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, misinformation propagation, and unintended behaviors have raised significant concerns. To address this challenge, we introduce G-Safeguard, a topology-guided security lens and treatment for robust LLM-MAS, which leverages graph neural networks to detect anomalies on the multi-agent utterance graph and employ topological intervention for attack remediation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that G-Safeguard: (I) exhibits significant effectiveness under various attack strategies, recovering over 40% of the performance for prompt injection; (II) is highly adaptable to diverse LLM backbones and large-scale MAS; (III) can seamlessly combine with mainstream MAS with security guarantees.

Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph Transformer called GCFormer. Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a popular framework for modeling molecular data, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of molecular representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called GODE, which accounts for the dual-level structure inherent in molecules. Molecules possess an intrinsic graph structure and simultaneously function as nodes within a broader molecular knowledge graph. GODE integrates individual molecular graph representations with multi-domain biochemical data from knowledge graphs. By pre-training two GNNs on different graph structures and employing contrastive learning, GODE effectively fuses molecular structures with their corresponding knowledge graph substructures. This fusion yields a more robust and informative representation, enhancing molecular property predictions by leveraging both chemical and biological information. When fine-tuned across 11 chemical property tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving an average ROC-AUC improvement of 12.7% for classification tasks and an average RMSE/MAE improvement of 34.4% for regression tasks. Notably, GODE surpasses the current leading model in property prediction, with advancements of 2.2% in classification and 7.2% in regression tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Such a setting is restricted in real-world applications, since the target network might contain additional classes that are not present in the source. In this work, we study a more realistic open-set cross-network node classification (O-CNNC) problem, where the target network contains all the known classes in the source and further contains several target-private classes unseen in the source. Borrowing the concept from open-set domain adaptation, all target-private classes are defined as an additional unknown class. To address the challenging O-CNNC problem, we propose an unknown-excluded adversarial graph domain alignment (UAGA) model with a separate-adapt training strategy. Firstly, UAGA roughly separates known classes from unknown class, by training a graph neural network encoder and a neighborhood-aggregation node classifier in an adversarial framework. Then, unknown-excluded adversarial domain alignment is customized to align only target nodes from known classes with the source, while pushing target nodes from unknown class far away from the source, by assigning positive and negative domain adaptation coefficient to known class nodes and unknown class nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant outperformance of the proposed UAGA over state-of-the-art methods on O-CNNC.</p></details> |  |

To train GNNs on large graphs that exceed CPU memory, several systems store data on disk and conduct out-of-core processing. However, these systems suffer from either read amplification when reading node features that are usually smaller than a disk page or degraded model accuracy by treating the graph as disconnected partitions. To close this gap, we build a system called DiskGNN, which achieves high I/O efficiency and thus fast training without hurting model accuracy. The key technique used by DiskGNN is offline sampling, which helps decouple graph sampling from model computation. In particular, by conducting graph sampling beforehand, DiskGNN acquires the node features that will be accessed by model computation, and such information is utilized to pack the target node features contiguously on disk to avoid read amplification. Besides, \name{} also adopts designs including four-level feature store to fully utilize the memory hierarchy to cache node features and reduce disk access, batched packing to accelerate the feature packing process, and pipelined training to overlap disk access with other operations. We compare DiskGNN with Ginex and MariusGNN, which are state-of-the-art systems for out-of-core GNN training. The results show that DiskGNN can speed up the baselines by over 8x while matching their best model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In these networks, nodes and edges often contain text descriptions, and the graph structure can evolve over time. Future link prediction, edge classification, relation generation, and other downstream tasks on DyTAGs require powerful representations that encode structural, temporal, and textual information. Although graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at handling structured data, encoding temporal information within dynamic graphs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Knowledge Distillation for Dynamic Text Attributed Graph (LKD4DyTAG) with temporal encoding to address these challenges. We use a simple, yet effective approach to encode temporal information in edges so that graph convolution can simultaneously capture both temporal and structural information in the hidden representations. To leverage LLM's text processing capabilities for learning richer representations on DyTAGs, we distill knowledge from LLM-driven edge representations (based on a neighborhood's text attributes) into saptio-temporal representations using a lightweight GNN model that encodes temporal and structural information. The objective of knowledge distillation enables the GNN to learn representations that more effectively encode the available structural, temporal, and textual information in DyTAG. We conducted extensive experimentation on six real-world DyTAG datasets to verify the effectiveness of our approach LKD4DyTAG for future link prediction and edge classification task. The results show that our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks compared to the baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI4TS: AI for Time Series Analysis workshop, AAAI 2025</p></details> |

The resulting mass fragmentation spectra are representations of molecules of which the structure may have not been determined. This poses the challenge of experimentally determining or computationally predicting molecular structures from mass spectra. An alternative option is to predict molecular properties or molecular similarity directly from spectra. Various methodologies have been proposed to embed mass spectra for further use in machine learning tasks. However, these methodologies require preprocessing of the spectra, which often includes binning or sub-sampling peaks with the main reasoning of creating uniform vector sizes and removing noise. Here, we investigate two alternatives to the binning of mass spectra before down-stream machine learning tasks, namely, set-based and graph-based representations.

Each representation method enables the application of various machine learning methodologies from linear regression to graph neural networks paired with large language models. To complement existing representations, we introduce the representation of molecules through vector-valued functions, or $n$-dimensional vector fields, that are parameterized by neural networks, which we denote molecular neural fields. Unlike surface representations, molecular neural fields capture external features and the hydrophobic core of macromolecules such as proteins. Compared to discrete graph or point representations, molecular neural fields are compact, resolution independent and inherently suited for interpolation in spatial and temporal dimensions. These properties inherited by molecular neural fields lend themselves to tasks including the generation of molecules based on their desired shape, structure, and composition, and the resolution-independent interpolation between molecular conformations in space and time. Here, we provide a framework and proofs-of-concept for molecular neural fields, namely, the parametrization and superresolution reconstruction of a protein-ligand complex using an auto-decoder architecture and the embedding of molecular volumes in latent space using an auto-encoder architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a tiny paper track submission to the LRML workshop at ICLR</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Domain Adaptation and Graph Neural Networks: A Tensor-Based Framework for Effective Label Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08505v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become the predominant tools for studying graph data. Despite state-of-the-art performance on graph classification tasks, GNNs are overwhelmingly trained in a single domain under supervision, thus necessitating a prohibitively high demand for labels and resulting in poorly transferable representations. To address this challenge, we propose the Label-Propagation Tensor Graph Neural Network (LP-TGNN) framework to bridge the gap between graph data and traditional domain adaptation methods. It extracts graph topological information holistically with a tensor architecture and then reduces domain discrepancy through label propagation. It is readily compatible with general GNNs and domain adaptation techniques with minimal adjustment through pseudo-labeling. Experiments on various real-world benchmarks show that our LP-TGNN outperforms baselines by a notable margin. We also validate and analyze each component of the proposed framework in the ablation study.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Vanishing Gradients, Over-Smoothing, and Over-Squashing in GNNs: Bridging Recurrent and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10818v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are models that leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing operation. While widely successful, this approach is well known to suffer from the over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena, which result in representational collapse as the number of layers increases and insensitivity to the information contained at distant and poorly connected nodes, respectively. In this paper, we present a unified view of these problems through the lens of vanishing gradients, using ideas from linear control theory for our analysis. We propose an interpretation of GNNs as recurrent models and empirically demonstrate that a simple state-space formulation of a GNN effectively alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing at no extra trainable parameter cost. Further, we show theoretically and empirically that (i) GNNs are by design prone to extreme gradient vanishing even after a few layers; (ii) Over-smoothing is directly related to the mechanism causing vanishing gradients; (iii) Over-squashing is most easily alleviated by a combination of graph rewiring and vanishing gradient mitigation. We believe our work will help bridge the gap between the recurrent and graph neural network literature and will unlock the design of new deep and performant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking GNN Expressive Power Research in the Machine Learning Community: Limitations, Issues, and Corrections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) has spurred theoretical explorations into their expressive power. In the graph machine learning community, researchers often equate GNNs with the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests as a foundation for theoretical analysis. However, we identify two major limitations of this approach: (1) the semantics of WL tests involve verifying purely structural equivalences through a set of logical sentences. As a result, they do not align well with the concept of expressive power, which is typically defined as the class of functions that GNNs can express, and they are not well-suited for handling graphs with features; (2) by leveraging communication complexity, we show that the lower bound on a GNN's capacity (depth multiplied by width) to simulate one iteration of the WL test grows almost linearly with the graph size. This finding indicates that the WL test is not locally computable and is misaligned with the message-passing GNNs. Furthermore, we show that allowing unlimited precomputation or directly integrating features computed by external models, while claiming that these precomputations enhance the expressiveness of GNNs, can sometimes lead to issues. Such problems can even be observed in an influential paper published in a top-tier machine learning conference. We argue that using well-defined computational models, such as the CONGEST model from distributed computing, is a reasonable approach to characterizing and exploring GNNs' expressive power. Following this approach, we present some results on the effects of virtual nodes and edges. Finally, we highlight several open problems regarding GNN expressive power for further exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distillation-based Future-aware Graph Neural Network for Stock Trend Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10776v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock trend prediction involves forecasting the future price movements by analyzing historical data and various market indicators. With the advancement of machine learning, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively employed in stock prediction due to their powerful capability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies of stocks. However, despite the efforts of various GNN stock predictors to enhance predictive performance, the improvements remain limited, as they focus solely on analyzing historical spatiotemporal dependencies, overlooking the correlation between historical and future patterns. In this study, we propose a novel distillation-based future-aware GNN framework (DishFT-GNN) for stock trend prediction. Specifically, DishFT-GNN trains a teacher model and a student model, iteratively. The teacher model learns to capture the correlation between distribution shifts of historical and future data, which is then utilized as intermediate supervision to guide the student model to learn future-aware spatiotemporal embeddings for accurate prediction. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we verify the state-of-the-art performance of DishFT-GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Community Detection in Hybrid Metaverse Networks with Integrated AI Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10750v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection is a cornerstone problem in social network analysis (SNA), aimed at identifying cohesive communities with minimal external links. However, the rise of generative AI and Metaverse introduce complexities by creating hybrid human-AI social networks (denoted by HASNs), where traditional methods fall short, especially in human-centric settings. This paper introduces a novel community detection problem in HASNs (denoted by MetaCD), which seeks to enhance human connectivity within communities while reducing the presence of AI nodes. Effective processing of MetaCD poses challenges due to the delicate trade-off between excluding certain AI nodes and maintaining community structure. To address this, we propose CUSA, an innovative framework incorporating AI-aware clustering techniques that navigate this trade-off by selectively retaining AI nodes that contribute to community integrity. Furthermore, given the scarcity of real-world HASNs, we devise four strategies for synthesizing these networks under various hypothetical scenarios. Empirical evaluations on real social networks, reconfigured as HASNs, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach compared to traditional non-deep learning and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Accepted for publication in the ACM WWW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated Data Quality Validation in an End-to-End GNN Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10667v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring data quality is crucial in modern data ecosystems, especially for training or testing datasets in machine learning. Existing validation approaches rely on computing data quality metrics and/or using expert-defined constraints. Although there are automated constraint generation methods, they are often incomplete and may be too strict or too soft, causing false positives or missed errors, thus requiring expert adjustment. These methods may also fail to detect subtle data inconsistencies hidden by complex interdependencies within the data. In this paper, we propose DQuag, an end-to-end data quality validation and repair framework based on an improved Graph Neural Network (GNN) and multi-task learning. The proposed method incorporates a dual-decoder design: one for data quality validation and the other for data repair. Our approach captures complex feature relationships within tabular datasets using a multi-layer GNN architecture to automatically detect explicit and hidden data errors. Unlike previous methods, our model does not require manual input for constraint generation and learns the underlying feature dependencies, enabling it to identify complex hidden errors that traditional systems often miss. Moreover, it can recommend repair values, improving overall data quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and resolving data quality issues. The paper appeared in EDBT 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Graph Neural Network Expressivity with Learnable Lanczos Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12334v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in handling graph-structured data but often underperform in link prediction tasks compared to classical methods, mainly due to the limitations of the commonly used message-passing principle. Notably, their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Our study presents a novel method to enhance the expressivity of GNNs by embedding induced subgraphs into the graph Laplacian matrix's eigenbasis. We introduce a Learnable Lanczos algorithm with Linear Constraints (LLwLC), proposing two novel subgraph extraction strategies: encoding vertex-deleted subgraphs and applying Neumann eigenvalue constraints. For the former, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish graphs that are indistinguishable by 2-WL, while maintaining efficient time complexity. The latter focuses on link representations enabling differentiation between $k$-regular graphs and node automorphism, a vital aspect for link prediction tasks. Our approach results in an extremely lightweight architecture, reducing the need for extensive training datasets. Empirically, our method improves performance in challenging link prediction tasks across benchmark datasets, establishing its practical utility and supporting our theoretical findings. Notably, LLwLC achieves 20x and 10x speedup by only requiring 5% and 10% data from the PubMed and OGBL-Vessel datasets while comparing to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Graph's Apprentice: Teaching an LLM Low Level Knowledge for Circuit Quality Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00843v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic synthesis is a crucial phase in the circuit design process, responsible for transforming hardware description language (HDL) designs into optimized netlists. However, traditional logic synthesis methods are computationally intensive, restricting their iterative use in refining chip designs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly those fine-tuned on programming languages, present a promising alternative. This work proposes augmenting LLMs with predictor networks trained to estimate circuit quality directly from HDL code. To enhance performance, the model is regularized using embeddings from graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on Look-Up Table (LUT) graphs, thereby incorporating lower-level circuit insights. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing graph-based RTL-level estimation techniques on the established benchmark OpenABCD, while providing instant feedback on HDL code quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGS-GNN: A Supervised Graph Sparsification method for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10208v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SGS-GNN, a novel supervised graph sparsifier that learns the sampling probability distribution of edges and samples sparse subgraphs of a user-specified size to reduce the computational costs required by GNNs for inference tasks on large graphs. SGS-GNN employs regularizers in the loss function to enhance homophily in sparse subgraphs, boosting the accuracy of GNNs on heterophilic graphs, where a significant number of the neighbors of a node have dissimilar labels. SGS-GNN also supports conditional updates of the probability distribution learning module based on a prior, which helps narrow the search space for sparse graphs. SGS-GNN requires fewer epochs to obtain high accuracies since it learns the search space of subgraphs more effectively than methods using fixed distributions such as random sampling. Extensive experiments using 33 homophilic and heterophilic graphs demonstrate the following: (i) with only 20% of edges retained in the sparse subgraphs, SGS-GNN improves the F1-scores by a geometric mean of 4% relative to the original graph; on heterophilic graphs, the prediction accuracy is better up to 30%. (ii) SGS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improvement in F1-scores of 4-7% in geometric mean with similar sparsities in the sampled subgraphs, and (iii) compared to sparsifiers that employ fixed distributions, SGS-GNN requires about half the number of epochs to converge.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMBINEX: A Unified Counterfactual Explainer for Graph Neural Networks via Node Feature and Structural Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10111v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a powerful tool to unveil the opaque decision-making processes of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing techniques primarily focus on edge modifications, often overlooking the crucial role of node feature perturbations in shaping model predictions. To address this limitation, we propose COMBINEX, a novel GNN explainer that generates counterfactual explanations for both node and graph classification tasks. Unlike prior methods, which treat structural and feature-based changes independently, COMBINEX optimally balances modifications to edges and node features by jointly optimizing these perturbations. This unified approach ensures minimal yet effective changes required to flip a model's prediction, resulting in realistic and interpretable counterfactuals. Additionally, COMBINEX seamlessly handles both continuous and discrete node features, enhancing its versatility across diverse datasets and GNN architectures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets and various GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach over existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |
