| **[Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their potential in graph machine learning remains largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. While many works on GFMs have focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) like TabPFNv2 or LimiX, we propose G2T-FM, a simple framework for turning tabular foundation models into graph foundation models. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies a TFM to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing competitively with, and often better than, well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines. In particular, when combined with LimiX, G2T-FM often outperforms the best GNN by a significant margin. In summary, our paper reveals the potential of a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/AutoGraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SEMMA: A Semantic Aware Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20422v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) have shown promise in enabling zero-shot reasoning over unseen graphs by learning transferable patterns. However, most existing KGFMs rely solely on graph structure, overlooking the rich semantic signals encoded in textual attributes. We introduce SEMMA, a dual-module KGFM that systematically integrates transferable textual semantics alongside structure. SEMMA leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich relation identifiers, generating semantic embeddings that subsequently form a textual relation graph, which is fused with the structural component. Across 54 diverse KGs, SEMMA outperforms purely structural baselines like ULTRA in fully inductive link prediction. Crucially, we show that in more challenging generalization settings, where the test-time relation vocabulary is entirely unseen, structural methods collapse while SEMMA is 2x more effective. Our findings demonstrate that textual semantics are critical for generalization in settings where structure alone fails, highlighting the need for foundation models that unify structural and linguistic signals in knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Two Facets of the Same Optimization Coin: Model Degradation and Representation Collapse in Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08401v4)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of LLMs, GFMs are designed to learn the optimal embedding functions from multi-domain text-attributed graphs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. Among the diverse architectures, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[G1: Teaching LLMs to Reason on Graphs with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18499v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphProp: Training the Graph Foundation Models using Graph Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04594v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification. Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in handling graphs without node attributes.</p></details> |  |

| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[SGPT: Few-Shot Prompt Tuning for Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

We introduce MX-AI, the first end-to-end agentic system that (i) instruments a live 5G Open RAN testbed based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, (ii) deploys a graph of Large-Language-Model (LLM)-powered agents inside the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) layer, and (iii) exposes both observability and control functions for 6G RAN resources through natural-language intents. On 50 realistic operational queries, MX-AI attains a mean answer quality of 4.1/5.0 and 100 % decision-action accuracy, while incurring only 8.8 seconds end-to-end latency when backed by GPT-4.1. Thus, it matches human-expert performance, validating its practicality in real settings. We publicly release the agent graph, prompts, and evaluation harness to accelerate open research on AI-native RANs.

| **[A Brain Graph Foundation Model: Pre-Training and Prompt-Tuning for Any Atlas and Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02044v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

| **[Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning via Adaptive Weight Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09132v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGMP:Heterogeneous Graph Multi-Task Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07405v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios. Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP. First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next, we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance model performance by refining the representation of input graph features. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[PLACE: Prompt Learning for Attributed Community Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05311v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover, we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries, where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts on average.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[FoGE: Fock Space inspired encoding for graph prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02937v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.</p></details> |  |

As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains.

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision.

Trojan Prompt Attacks on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13974v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has been introduced as a promising approach that uses prompts to adapt pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the entire model. Despite the advantages of GPL, little attention has been given to its vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where an adversary can manipulate the model's behavior by embedding hidden triggers. Existing graph backdoor attacks rely on modifying model parameters during training, but this approach is impractical in GPL as GNN encoder parameters are frozen after pre-training. Moreover, downstream users may fine-tune their own task models on clean datasets, further complicating the attack. In this paper, we propose TGPA, a backdoor attack framework designed specifically for GPL. TGPA injects backdoors into graph prompts without modifying pre-trained GNN encoders and ensures high attack success rates and clean accuracy. To address the challenge of model fine-tuning by users, we introduce a finetuning-resistant poisoning approach that maintains the effectiveness of the backdoor even after downstream model adjustments. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TGPA in compromising GPL models with fixed GNN encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in KDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision Graph Prompting via Semantic Low-Rank Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04121v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision GNN (ViG) demonstrates superior performance by representing images as graph structures, providing a more natural way to capture irregular semantic patterns beyond traditional grid or sequence-based representations. To efficiently adapt ViG to downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like visual prompting become increasingly essential. However, existing prompting methods are primarily designed for Transformer-based models, neglecting the rich topological relationships among nodes and edges in graph-based representations, limiting their capacity to model complex semantics. In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties. Building on this observation, we introduce a semantic low-rank prompting method that decomposes low-rank semantic features and integrates them with prompts on vision graph topologies, capturing both global structural patterns and fine-grained semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method significantly improves ViG's transfer performance on diverse downstream tasks, achieving results comparable to full fine-tuning while maintaining parameter efficiency.

However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.

| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources. These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation. To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation. FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[GraphPrompter: Multi-stage Adaptive Prompt Optimization for Graph In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02027v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%.

Most existing studies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational contexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational contexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational contexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal semantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language models to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and contextually relevant content in response generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-Aware Graph Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17619v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to detect unseen anomaly regions with the guidance of very few normal support images from the same class. Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach. We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion. With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peer ...</summary><p>Peer reviewed and published at NLP4KGc @ Semantics 2024, see original publication at https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3874/paper3.pdf .

| **[Krait: A Backdoor Attack Against Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13068v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph prompt tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm to effectively transfer general graph knowledge from pre-trained models to various downstream tasks, particularly in few-shot contexts. However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SaTML'2025</p></details> |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph prompt learning has emerged as a powerful GNN training paradigm, inspired by advances in language and vision foundation models. Here, a GNN is pre-trained on public data and then adapted to sensitive tasks using lightweight graph prompts. However, using prompts from sensitive data poses privacy risks. In this work, we are the first to investigate these practical risks in graph prompts by instantiating a membership inference attack that reveals significant privacy leakage. We also find that the standard privacy method, DP-SGD, fails to provide practical privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning, likely due to the small number of sensitive data points used to learn the prompts. As a solution, we propose DP-GPL for differentially private graph prompt learning based on the PATE framework, that generates a graph prompt with differential privacy guarantees. Our evaluation across various graph prompt learning methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies demonstrates that our algorithm achieves high utility at strong privacy, effectively mitigating privacy concerns while preserving the powerful capabilities of prompted GNNs as powerful foundation models in the graph domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

However, inevitable objective gaps often exist between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompt tuning techniques design and learn graph prompts by manipulating input graphs or reframing downstream tasks as pre-training tasks without fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN models. While recent graph prompt tuning methods have proven effective in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, they overlook the crucial role of edges in graph prompt design, which can significantly affect the quality of graph representations for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose EdgePrompt, a simple yet effective graph prompt tuning method from the perspective of edges. Unlike previous studies that design prompt vectors on node features, EdgePrompt manipulates input graphs by learning additional prompt vectors for edges and incorporates the edge prompts through message passing in the pre-trained GNN models to better embed graph structural information for downstream tasks. Our method is compatible with prevalent GNN architectures pre-trained under various pre-training strategies and is universal for different downstream tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses of our method regarding its capability of handling node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against six baselines.

These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combating this challenge are generally impractical, due to the imbalance of classes and scarcity of labeled samples in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT, that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify drug trafficking activities in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over the unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, we employ LLM to augment the HG by generating high-quality synthetic user nodes in minority classes. Then, we fine-tune the soft prompts on the augmented HG to capture the important information in the minority classes for the downstream drug trafficking detection task. To comprehensively study online illicit drug trafficking activities, we collect a new HG dataset over Twitter, called Twitter-HetDrug. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of LLM-HetGDT.</p></details> |  |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in NAACL 2025.

Existing studies on heterogeneous graph prompting typically use feature prompts to modify node features for specific downstream tasks, which do not concern the structure of heterogeneous graphs. Such a design also overlooks information from the meta-paths, which are core to learning the high-order semantics of the heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose CLEAR, a Cluster-based prompt LEARNING model on heterogeneous graphs. We present cluster prompts that reformulate downstream tasks as heterogeneous graph reconstruction. In this way, we align the pretext and downstream tasks to share the same training objective. Additionally, our cluster prompts are also injected into the meta-paths such that the prompt learning process incorporates high-order semantic information entailed by the meta-paths.

The prevailing "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm has been widely adopted in graph machine learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled nodes. However, this approach often exhibits a misalignment between the training objectives of pretext tasks and those of downstream tasks. This gap can result in the "negative transfer" problem, wherein the knowledge gained from pre-training adversely affects performance in the downstream tasks. The surge in prompt-based learning within Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggests the potential of adapting a "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to graphs as an alternative. However, existing graph prompting techniques are tailored to homogeneous graphs, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of Web graphs. To bridge this gap, we propose HetGPT, a general post-training prompting framework to improve the predictive performance of pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The key is the design of a novel prompting function that integrates a virtual class prompt and a heterogeneous feature prompt, with the aim to reformulate downstream tasks to mirror pretext tasks. Moreover, HetGPT introduces a multi-view neighborhood aggregation mechanism, capturing the complex neighborhood structure in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate HetGPT's capability to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art HGNNs on semi-supervised node classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

However, an objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks limits its effectiveness. Recent graph prompting methods aim to close this gap through task reformulations and learnable prompts. Despite this, they struggle with complex graphs like heterophily graphs. Freezing the GNN encoder can reduce the impact of prompting, while simple prompts fail to handle diverse hop-level distributions. This paper identifies two key challenges in adapting graph prompting methods for complex graphs: (1) adapting the model to new distributions in downstream tasks to mitigate pre-training and fine-tuning discrepancies from heterophily and (2) customizing prompts for hop-specific node requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Graph Prompt Tuning (DAGPrompT), which integrates a GLoRA module for optimizing the GNN encoder's projection matrix and message-passing schema through low-rank adaptation. DAGPrompT also incorporates hop-specific prompts accounting for varying graph structures and distributions among hops. Evaluations on 10 datasets and 14 baselines demonstrate that DAGPrompT improves accuracy by up to 4.79 in node and graph classification tasks, setting a new state-of-the-art while preserving efficiency.

Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

| **[SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Prompt-based Unifying Inference Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15735v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide important prospective insights in applications such as social behavior analysis and financial risk analysis based on their powerful learning capabilities on graph data. Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

A Few-Shot Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11387v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the robotics domain by enabling robots to comprehend and execute natural language instructions. The cornerstone benefits of LLM include processing textual data from technical manuals, instructions, academic papers, and user queries based on the knowledge provided. However, deploying LLM-generated code in robotic systems without safety verification poses significant risks. This paper outlines a safety layer that verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a drone in a simulated environment. The safety layer consists of a fine-tuned GPT-4o model using Few-Shot learning, supported by knowledge graph prompting (KGP). Our approach improves the safety and compliance of robotic actions, ensuring that they adhere to the regulations of drone operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17676v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph representation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the performance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an end-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been proposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the pretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt learning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with minimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the current exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on learning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the diverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming to generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process involves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight architecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and employing the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the superior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphTheft: Quantifying Privacy Risks in Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14718v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) represents an innovative approach in graph representation learning, enabling task-specific adaptations by fine-tuning prompts without altering the underlying pre-trained model. Despite its growing prominence, the privacy risks inherent in GPL remain unexplored. In this study, we provide the first evaluation of privacy leakage in GPL across three attacker capabilities: black-box attacks when GPL as a service, and scenarios where node embeddings and prompt representations are accessible to third parties. We assess GPL's privacy vulnerabilities through Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs) and Link Inference Attacks (LIAs), finding that under any capability, attackers can effectively infer the properties and relationships of sensitive nodes, and the success rate of inference on some data sets is as high as 98%. Importantly, while targeted inference attacks on specific prompts (e.g., GPF-plus) maintain high success rates, our analysis suggests that the prompt-tuning in GPL does not significantly elevate privacy risks compared to traditional GNNs. To mitigate these risks, we explored defense mechanisms, identifying that Laplacian noise perturbation can substantially reduce inference success, though balancing privacy protection with model performance remains challenging. This work highlights critical privacy risks in GPL, offering new insights and foundational directions for future privacy-preserving strategies in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally focus on a single graph object type (node, edge, graph, etc.) and often overlook the inherent connections among different object types of graph anomalies. For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an abnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this, we present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node, edge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh Quotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by transferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We theoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy of subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant anomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a novel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels, adjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting training goals. Comprehensive experiments show that UniGAD outperforms both existing GAD methods specialized for a single task and graph prompt-based approaches for multiple tasks, while also providing robust zero-shot task transferability.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Against Multifaceted Graph Heterogeneity via Asymmetric Federated Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02003v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to collaboratively and privately optimize graph models on divergent data for different tasks. A critical challenge in FGL is to enable effective yet efficient federated optimization against multifaceted graph heterogeneity to enhance mutual performance. However, existing FGL works primarily address graph data heterogeneity and perform incapable of graph task heterogeneity. To address the challenge, we propose a Federated Graph Prompt Learning (FedGPL) framework to efficiently enable prompt-based asymmetric graph knowledge transfer between multifaceted heterogeneous federated participants. Generally, we establish a split federated framework to preserve universal and domain-specific graph knowledge, respectively. Moreover, we develop two algorithms to eliminate task and data heterogeneity for advanced federated knowledge preservation. First, a Hierarchical Directed Transfer Aggregator (HiDTA) delivers cross-task beneficial knowledge that is hierarchically distilled according to the directional transferability. Second, a Virtual Prompt Graph (VPG) adaptively generates graph structures to enhance data utility by distinguishing dominant subgraphs and neutralizing redundant ones. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant accuracy and efficiency effectiveness of FedGPL against multifaceted graph heterogeneity compared to state-of-the-art baselines on large-scale federated graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDIPrompt: Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction based on Graph Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472v5)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug combinations can cause adverse drug-drug interactions(DDIs). Identifying specific effects is crucial for developing safer therapies. Previous works on DDI event prediction have typically been limited to using labels of specific events as supervision, which renders them insufficient to address two significant challenges: (1) the bias caused by \textbf{highly imbalanced event distribution} where certain interaction types are vastly under-represented. (2) the \textbf{scarcity of labeled data for rare events}, a pervasive issue where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-explored due to limited available data. In response, we offer ``DDIPrompt'', an innovative solution inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompt learning. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt features a hierarchical pre-training strategy to foster a generalized and comprehensive understanding of drug properties. It captures intra-molecular structures through augmented links based on structural proximity between drugs, further learns inter-molecular interactions emphasizing edge connections rather than concrete catagories. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate DDIPrompt's SOTA performance, especially for those rare DDI events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable and Compact Graph Fine-tuning via GraphSparse Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21749v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph prompt learning has garnered increasing attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. However, existing works generally conduct prompting over all graph elements (e.g., nodes, edges, node attributes, etc.), which is suboptimal and obviously redundant. To address this issue, we propose exploiting sparse representation theory for graph prompting and present Graph Sparse Prompting (GSP). GSP aims to adaptively and sparsely select the optimal elements (e.g., certain node attributes) to achieve compact prompting for downstream tasks. Specifically, we propose two kinds of GSP models, termed Graph Sparse Feature Prompting (GSFP) and Graph Sparse multi-Feature Prompting (GSmFP). Both GSFP and GSmFP provide a general scheme for tuning any specific pre-trained GNNs that can achieve attribute selection and compact prompt learning simultaneously. A simple yet effective algorithm has been designed for solving GSFP and GSmFP models. Experiments on 16 widely-used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSFPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10341v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

This paper introduces a Causality Graph Event Prediction(CGEP) task that forecasting consequential event based on an Event Causality Graph (ECG). We propose a Semantic Enhanced Distance-sensitive Graph Prompt Learning (SeDGPL) Model for the CGEP task. In SeDGPL, (1) we design a Distance-sensitive Graph Linearization (DsGL) module to reformulate the ECG into a graph prompt template as the input of a PLM; (2) propose an Event-Enriched Causality Encoding (EeCE) module to integrate both event contextual semantic and graph schema information; (3) propose a Semantic Contrast Event Prediction (ScEP) module to enhance the event representation among numerous candidate events and predict consequential event following prompt learning paradigm. %We construct two CGEP datasets based on existing MAVEN-ERE and ESC corpus for experiments. Experiment results validate our argument our proposed SeDGPL model outperforms the advanced competitors for the CGEP task.</p></details> |  |

This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems.

However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To reduce labeling requirement, the "pre-train, prompt" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TKDE.

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose \textbf{One for All (OFA)}, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, Published at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-test approach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streaming recommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as a novel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely on historical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stability issue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle these difficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streaming Recommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec first disentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specific interaction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizes lightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varying interaction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level prompts are employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes or properties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-level prompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity and relationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovatively designed to facilitate the aggregation of information from multiple disentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize a comprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects of the user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated. Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2024</p></details> |

While established techniques enable handling multi-modal information, the challenges are posed when extended to various clinical modalities and practical modalitymissing setting due to the inherent modality gaps. To tackle these, we propose an innovative Modality-prompted Heterogeneous Graph for Omnimodal Learning (GTP-4o), which embeds the numerous disparate clinical modalities into a unified representation, completes the deficient embedding of missing modality and reformulates the cross-modal learning with a graph-based aggregation. Specially, we establish a heterogeneous graph embedding to explicitly capture the diverse semantic properties on both the modality-specific features (nodes) and the cross-modal relations (edges). Then, we design a modality-prompted completion that enables completing the inadequate graph representation of missing modality through a graph prompting mechanism, which generates hallucination graphic topologies to steer the missing embedding towards the intact representation. Through the completed graph, we meticulously develop a knowledge-guided hierarchical cross-modal aggregation consisting of a global meta-path neighbouring to uncover the potential heterogeneous neighbors along the pathways driven by domain knowledge, and a local multi-relation aggregation module for the comprehensive cross-modal interaction across various heterogeneous relations. We assess the efficacy of our methodology on rigorous benchmarking experiments against prior state-of-the-arts. In a nutshell, GTP-4o presents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of embedding, relating and perceiving the heterogeneous patterns from various clinical modalities holistically via a graph theory.

Nonetheless, applying existing prompt learning methods for the diagnosis of neurological disorder still suffers from two issues: (i) existing methods typically treat all patches equally, despite the fact that only a small number of patches in neuroimaging are relevant to the disease, and (ii) they ignore the structural information inherent in the brain connection network which is crucial for understanding and diagnosing neurological disorders. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel prompt learning model by learning graph prompts during the fine-tuning process of multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Specifically, we first leverage GPT-4 to obtain relevant disease concepts and compute semantic similarity between these concepts and all patches. Secondly, we reduce the weight of irrelevant patches according to the semantic similarity between each patch and disease-related concepts. Moreover, we construct a graph among tokens based on these concepts and employ a graph convolutional network layer to extract the structural information of the graph, which is used to prompt the pre-trained multimodal large models for diagnosing neurological disorders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance for neurological disorder diagnosis compared with state-of-the-art methods and validated by clinicians.</p></details> |  |

Graph prompt learning emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging lightweight prompts to manipulate data and fill the task gap by reformulating downstream tasks to the pretext. However, several critical challenges still remain: how to unify diverse graph prompt models, how to evaluate the quality of graph prompts, and to improve their usability for practical comparisons and selection. In response to these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for graph prompt learning. Our benchmark integrates SIX pre-training methods and FIVE state-of-the-art graph prompt techniques, evaluated across FIFTEEN diverse datasets to assess performance, flexibility, and efficiency. We also present 'ProG', an easy-to-use open-source library that streamlines the execution of various graph prompt models, facilitating objective evaluations. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that categorizes existing graph prompt methods into two main approaches: prompts as graphs and prompts as tokens. This framework enhances the applicability and comparison of graph prompt techniques. The code is available at: https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG.</p></details> |  |

As a kind of universal graph prompt learning method, Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) has achieved remarkable success in adapting pre-trained models for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By fixing the parameters of a pre-trained GNN model, the aim of GPF is to modify the input graph data by adding some (learnable) prompt vectors into graph node features to better align with the downstream tasks on the smaller dataset. However, existing GPFs generally suffer from two main limitations. First, GPFs generally focus on node prompt learning which ignore the prompting for graph edges. Second, existing GPFs generally conduct the prompt learning on all nodes equally which fails to capture the importances of different nodes and may perform sensitively w.r.t noisy nodes in aligning with the downstream tasks. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new unified Graph Selective Prompt Feature learning (GSPF) for GNN fine-tuning. The proposed GSPF integrates the prompt learning on both graph node and edge together, which thus provides a unified prompt model for the graph data. Moreover, it conducts prompt learning selectively on nodes and edges by concentrating on the important nodes and edges for prompting which thus make our model be more reliable and compact. Experimental results on many benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed GSPF method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Pro: A Self-Prompt and Tuning Framework for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10362v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become an important modeling tool for web applications, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning. However, the performance of traditional GNNs heavily relies on a large amount of supervision. Recently, ``pre-train, fine-tune'' has become the paradigm to address the issues of label dependency and poor generalization. However, the pre-training strategies vary for graphs with homophily and heterophily, and the objectives for various downstream tasks also differ. This leads to a gap between pretexts and downstream tasks, resulting in ``negative transfer'' and poor performance. Inspired by prompt learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), many studies turn to bridge the gap and fully leverage the pre-trained model. However, existing methods for graph prompting are tailored to homophily, neglecting inherent heterophily on graphs. Meanwhile, most of them rely on the randomly initialized prompts, which negatively impact on the stability. Therefore, we propose Self-Prompt, a prompting framework for graphs based on the model and data itself. We first introduce asymmetric graph contrastive learning for pretext to address heterophily and align the objectives of pretext and downstream tasks. Then we reuse the component from pre-training phase as the self adapter and introduce self-prompts based on graph itself for task adaptation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets to demonstrate its superiority. We provide our codes at https://github.com/gongchenghua/Self-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |

While GPL offers superior effectiveness in graph knowledge transfer and computational efficiency, the security risks posed by backdoor poisoning effects embedded in pretrained models remain largely unexplored. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of GPL's vulnerability to backdoor attacks. We introduce \textit{CrossBA}, the first cross-context backdoor attack against GPL, which manipulates only the pretraining phase without requiring knowledge of downstream applications. Our investigation reveals both theoretically and empirically that tuning trigger graphs, combined with prompt transformations, can seamlessly transfer the backdoor threat from pretrained encoders to downstream applications. Through extensive experiments involving 3 representative GPL methods across 5 distinct cross-context scenarios and 5 benchmark datasets of node and graph classification tasks, we demonstrate that \textit{CrossBA} consistently achieves high attack success rates while preserving the functionality of downstream applications over clean input. We also explore potential countermeasures against \textit{CrossBA} and conclude that current defenses are insufficient to mitigate \textit{CrossBA}. Our study highlights the persistent backdoor threats to GPL systems, raising trustworthiness concerns in the practices of GPL techniques.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Tuning Large Language Models for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18271v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15240v5)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has sparked a research surge in adapting pre-trained models. Unlike the unified pre-training strategy employed in the language field, the graph field exhibits diverse pre-training strategies, posing challenges in designing appropriate prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. While some pioneering work has devised specialized prompting functions for models that employ edge prediction as their pre-training tasks, these methods are limited to specific pre-trained GNN models and lack broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce a universal prompt-based tuning method called Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) for pre-trained GNN models under any pre-training strategy. GPF operates on the input graph's feature space and can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect to any form of prompting function. Consequently, we no longer need to illustrate the prompting function corresponding to each pre-training strategy explicitly. Instead, we employ GPF to obtain the prompted graph for the downstream task in an adaptive manner. We provide rigorous derivations to demonstrate the universality of GPF and make guarantee of its effectiveness. The experimental results under various pre-training strategies indicate that our method performs better than fine-tuning, with an average improvement of about 1.4% in full-shot scenarios and about 3.2% in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, our method significantly outperforms existing specialized prompt-based tuning methods when applied to models utilizing the pre-training strategy they specialize in. These numerous advantages position our method as a compelling alternative to fine-tuning for downstream adaptations.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing the challenge of aligning pre-trained models with varied graph tasks (node level, edge level, and graph level), which can lead to negative transfer and poor performance, we propose a multi-task prompting method for graphs. This method involves unifying graph and language prompt formats, enabling NLP's prompting strategies to be adapted for graph tasks. By analyzing the task space of graph applications, we reformulate problems to fit graph-level tasks and apply meta-learning to improve prompt initialization for multiple tasks.

| **[Prompt Learning on Temporal Interaction Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06326v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Interaction Graphs (TIGs) are widely utilized to represent real-world systems. To facilitate representation learning on TIGs, researchers have proposed a series of TIG models. However, these models are still facing two tough gaps between the pre-training and downstream predictions in their ``pre-train, predict'' training paradigm. First, the temporal discrepancy between the pre-training and inference data severely undermines the models' applicability in distant future predictions on the dynamically evolving data. Second, the semantic divergence between pretext and downstream tasks hinders their practical applications, as they struggle to align with their learning and prediction capabilities across application scenarios. Recently, the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm has emerged as a lightweight mechanism for model generalization. Applying this paradigm is a potential solution to solve the aforementioned challenges. However, the adaptation of this paradigm to TIGs is not straightforward. The application of prompting in static graph contexts falls short in temporal settings due to a lack of consideration for time-sensitive dynamics and a deficiency in expressive power. To address this issue, we introduce Temporal Interaction Graph Prompting (TIGPrompt), a versatile framework that seamlessly integrates with TIG models, bridging both the temporal and semantic gaps. In detail, we propose a temporal prompt generator to offer temporally-aware prompts for different tasks. These prompts stand out for their minimalistic design, relying solely on the tuning of the prompt generator with very little supervision data. To cater to varying computational resource demands, we propose an extended ``pre-train, prompt-based fine-tune'' paradigm, offering greater flexibility. Through extensive experiments, the TIGPrompt demonstrates the SOTA performance and remarkable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompting pipeline, named \method, that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs' inference and transparency. Our method enables LLMs to comprehend KG inputs and infer with a combination of implicit and external knowledge. Moreover, our method elicits the mind map of LLMs, which reveals their reasoning pathways based on the ontology of knowledge. We evaluate our method on diverse question \& answering tasks, especially in medical domains, and show significant improvements over baselines. We also introduce a new hallucination evaluation benchmark and analyze the effects of different components of our method. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in merging knowledge from LLMs and KGs for combined inference.

| **[Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt: Bridging the Gap between Graph Pre-training and Inductive Fine-tuning From Spectral Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13556v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "Graph pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm has significantly improved Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) by capturing general knowledge without manual annotations for downstream tasks. However, due to the immense gap of data and tasks between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, the model performance is still limited. Inspired by prompt fine-tuning in Natural Language Processing(NLP), many endeavors have been made to bridge the gap in graph domain. But existing methods simply reformulate the form of fine-tuning tasks to the pre-training ones. With the premise that the pre-training graphs are compatible with the fine-tuning ones, these methods typically operate in transductive setting. In order to generalize graph pre-training to inductive scenario where the fine-tuning graphs might significantly differ from pre-training ones, we propose a novel graph prompt based method called Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt(IGAP). Firstly, we unify the mainstream graph pre-training frameworks and analyze the essence of graph pre-training from graph spectral theory. Then we identify the two sources of the data gap in inductive setting: (i) graph signal gap and (ii) graph structure gap. Based on the insight of graph pre-training, we propose to bridge the graph signal gap and the graph structure gap with learnable prompts in the spectral space. A theoretical analysis ensures the effectiveness of our method. At last, we conduct extensive experiments among nodes classification and graph classification tasks under the transductive, semi-inductive and inductive settings. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully bridge the data gap under different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Prompting for Multi-Document Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11730v3)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The `pre-train, prompt, predict' paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in open-domain question answering (OD-QA). However, few works explore this paradigm in the scenario of multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of different documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or intra-document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504v2)** | 2023-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, ''pre-training and fine-tuning'' has been adopted as a standard workflow for many graph tasks since it can take general graph knowledge to relieve the lack of graph annotations from each application. However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments, results from which demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 23 Best Research Paper Award, which is the first for Hong Kong and Mainland China.

This paper presents a pioneering survey on the emerging domain of graph prompts in AGI, addressing key challenges and opportunities in harnessing graph data for AGI applications. Despite substantial advancements in AGI across natural language processing and computer vision, the application to graph data is relatively underexplored. This survey critically evaluates the current landscape of AGI in handling graph data, highlighting the distinct challenges in cross-modality, cross-domain, and cross-task applications specific to graphs.

| **[Contrastive Graph Prompt-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10685v2)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are frequently challenged by the data sparsity problem. One approach to mitigate this issue is through cross-domain recommendation techniques. In a cross-domain context, sharing knowledge between domains can enhance the effectiveness in the target domain. Recent cross-domain methods have employed a pre-training approach, but we argue that these methods often result in suboptimal fine-tuning, especially with large neural models. Modern language models utilize prompts for efficient model tuning. Such prompts act as a tunable latent vector, allowing for the freezing of the main model parameters. In our research, we introduce the Personalised Graph Prompt-based Recommendation (PGPRec) framework. This leverages the advantages of prompt-tuning. Within this framework, we formulate personalized graph prompts item-wise, rooted in items that a user has previously engaged with. Specifically, we employ Contrastive Learning (CL) to produce pre-trained embeddings that offer greater generalizability in the pre-training phase, ensuring robust training during the tuning phase. Our evaluation of PGPRec in cross-domain scenarios involves comprehensive testing with the top-k recommendation tasks and a cold-start analysis. Our empirical findings, based on four Amazon Review datasets, reveal that the PGPRec framework can decrease the tuned parameters by as much as 74%, maintaining competitive performance. Remarkably, there's an 11.41% enhancement in performance against the leading baseline in cold-start situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Prompt Tuning for Graph Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10131v1)** | 2023-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph transformers have gained popularity in various graph-based tasks by addressing challenges faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results. This work brings attention to a promising approach to leverage pre-trained models in graph based prediction tasks and offers new opportunities for exploring and advancing graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |

While many GNN-based solutions have emerged, the supervised paradigm depends on a large quantity of labeled data. A popular alternative is to adopt self-supervised pre-training using label-free data, and further fine-tune on a downstream task with limited labels. Nevertheless, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is often plagued by the objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. Hence, we propose VPGNN, a prompt-based fine-tuning framework on GNNs for voucher abuse detection. We design a novel graph prompting function to reformulate the downstream task into a similar template as the pretext task in pre-training, thereby narrowing the objective gap. Extensive experiments on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate the strength of VPGNN in both few-shot and semi-supervised scenarios. Moreover, an online deployment of VPGNN in a production environment shows a 23.4% improvement over two existing deployed models.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted by CIKM23 Applied Research Track</p></details> |

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model. It is worth mentioning that this paper is a technical report of our pre-release version, and we will report our specific experimental data in future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGL-PT: A Strong Graph Learner with Graph Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12449v2)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, much exertion has been paid to design graph self-supervised methods to obtain generalized pre-trained models, and adapt pre-trained models onto downstream tasks through fine-tuning. However, there exists an inherent gap between pretext and downstream graph tasks, which insufficiently exerts the ability of pre-trained models and even leads to negative transfer. Meanwhile, prompt tuning has seen emerging success in natural language processing by aligning pre-training and fine-tuning with consistent training objectives. In this paper, we identify the challenges for graph prompt tuning: The first is the lack of a strong and universal pre-training task across sundry pre-training methods in graph domain. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of designing a consistent training objective for both pre-training and downstream tasks. To overcome above obstacles, we propose a novel framework named SGL-PT which follows the learning strategy ``Pre-train, Prompt, and Predict''. Specifically, we raise a strong and universal pre-training task coined as SGL that acquires the complementary merits of generative and contrastive self-supervised graph learning. And aiming for graph classification task, we unify pre-training and fine-tuning by designing a novel verbalizer-free prompting function, which reformulates the downstream task in a similar format as pretext task. Empirical results show that our method surpasses other baselines under unsupervised setting, and our prompt tuning method can greatly facilitate models on biological datasets over fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

The approach involves using a pre-trained model and a prompting function that applies a template to input samples, adding indicative context and reformulating target tasks as the pre-training task. However, the design of prompts could be a challenging and time-consuming process in complex tasks. The limitation can be addressed by using graph data, as graphs serve as structured knowledge repositories by explicitly modeling the interaction between entities. In this survey, we review prompting methods from the graph perspective, where prompting functions are augmented with graph knowledge. In particular, we introduce the basic concepts of graph prompt learning, organize the existing work of designing graph prompting functions, and describe their applications and future challenges. This survey will bridge the gap between graphs and prompt design to facilitate future methodology development.</p></details> | 9 pages + 1 figure |

Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7% improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Acoustic event Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14893v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal acoustic event classification plays a key role in audio-visual systems. Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness of Link Sign Prediction in Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10590v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed graphs serve as fundamental data structures for representing positive and negative relationships in social networks, with signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) emerging as the primary tool for their analysis. Our investigation reveals that balance theory, while essential for modeling signed relationships in SGNNs, inadvertently introduces exploitable vulnerabilities to black-box attacks. To showcase this, we propose balance-attack, a novel adversarial strategy specifically designed to compromise graph balance degree, and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the associated NP-hard optimization problem. While existing approaches attempt to restore attacked graphs through balance learning techniques, they face a critical challenge we term "Irreversibility of Balance-related Information," as restored edges fail to align with original attack targets. To address this limitation, we introduce Balance Augmented-Signed Graph Contrastive Learning (BA-SGCL), an innovative framework that combines contrastive learning with balance augmentation techniques to achieve robust graph representations. By maintaining high balance degree in the latent space, BA-SGCL not only effectively circumvents the irreversibility challenge but also significantly enhances model resilience. Extensive experiments across multiple SGNN architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our proposed balance-attack and the superior robustness of BA-SGCL, advancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social networks. Datasets and codes of the proposed framework are at the github repository https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BA-SGCL-submit-DF41/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05115v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems, demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Despite notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU), which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations. Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,conference</p></details> |
| **[Robust Graph Contrastive Learning with Information Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12555v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework has gained remarkable achievements in graph representation learning. However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification.

This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by COLING2025</p></details> |

Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI2024</p></details> |

However, conventional GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety of datasets and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Graph...</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, Representation Learning</p></details> |

We propose SSEmb, a novel embedding framework capable of capturing both structural and semantic features of mathematical formulas. Structurally, we employ Graph Contrastive Learning to encode formulas represented as Operator Graphs. To enhance structural diversity while preserving mathematical validity of these formula graphs, we introduce a novel graph data augmentation approach through a substitution strategy. Semantically, we utilize Sentence-BERT to encode the surrounding text of formulas. Finally, for each query and its candidates, structural and semantic similarities are calculated separately and then fused through a weighted scheme. In the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval task, SSEmb outperforms existing embedding-based methods by over 5 percentage points on P'@10 and nDCG'@10. Furthermore, SSEmb enhances the performance of all runs of other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with Approach0.</p></details> |  |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

In particular, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful self-supervised method that relies on applying perturbations to graphs for data augmentation. However, when applying existing GCL methods to biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), they overlooked meaningful biologically relevant perturbations, e.g., gene knockdowns. In this study, we introduce SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations derived from gene knockdown experiments as the supervision. SupGCL mathematically extends existing GCL methods that utilize non-biological perturbations to probabilistic models that introduce actual biological gene perturbation utilizing gene knockdown data. Using the GRN representation obtained by our proposed method, our aim is to improve the performance of biological downstream tasks such as patient hazard prediction and disease subtype classification (graph-level task), and gene function classification (node-level task). We applied SupGCL on real GRN datasets derived from patients with multiple types of cancer, and in all experiments SupGCL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Revisiting Graph Contrastive Learning on Anomaly Detection: A Structural Imbalance Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14677v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems. Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance, which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head anomalies and tail anomalies.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However, this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses, resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training.

To address the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that maximizes mutual information between contrastive views. However, existing GCL methods rely on augmentation techniques that introduce semantically irrelevant noise and incur significant computational and storage costs, limiting effectiveness and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose NLGCL, a novel contrastive learning framework that leverages naturally contrastive views between neighbor layers within GNNs. By treating each node and its neighbors in the next layer as positive pairs, and other nodes as negatives, NLGCL avoids augmentation-based noise while preserving semantic relevance. This paradigm eliminates costly view construction and storage, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that NLGCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RecSys 2025 as Spotlight Oral</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we reveal an unexpected vulnerability: the integration of GCL inadvertently increases the susceptibility of a recommender to targeted promotion attacks. Through both theoretical investigation and empirical validation, we identify the root cause as the spectral smoothing effect induced by contrastive optimization, which disperses item embeddings across the representation space and unintentionally enhances the exposure of target items. Building on this insight, we introduce CLeaR, a bi-level optimization attack method that deliberately amplifies spectral smoothness, enabling a systematic investigation of the susceptibility of GCL-based recommendation models to targeted promotion attacks. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust countermeasures; in response, we further propose SIM, a spectral irregularity mitigation framework designed to accurately detect and suppress targeted items without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared to existing targeted promotion attacks, GCL-based recommendation models exhibit greater susceptibility when evaluated with CLeaR, while SIM effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, current GCL methods primarily focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes, which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL). Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in graph representation learning.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning, especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes. However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal (negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes.

However, recent findings indicate that the presence of noise in real-world graph data can substantially impair the effectiveness of GNNs. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust and innovative node representation learning method named Graph Contrastive Learning with Low-Rank Regularization, or GCL-LRR, which follows a two-stage transductive learning framework for node classification. In the first stage, the GCL-LRR encoder is optimized through prototypical contrastive learning while incorporating a low-rank regularization objective. In the second stage, the representations generated by GCL-LRR are employed by a linear transductive classifier to predict the labels of unlabeled nodes within the graph. Our GCL-LRR is inspired by the Low Frequency Property (LFP) of the graph data and its labels, and it is also theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for transductive learning. To the best of our knowledge, our theoretical result is among the first to theoretically demonstrate the advantage of low-rank regularization in transductive learning, which is also supported by strong empirical results. To further enhance the performance of GCL-LRR, we present an improved model named GCL-LR-Attention, which incorporates a novel LR-Attention layer into GCL-LRR. GCL-LR-Attention reduces the kernel complexity of GCL-LRR and contributes to a tighter generalization bound, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets evidence the effectiveness and robustness of both GCL-LRR and GCL-LR-Attention in learning meaningful node representations.

Their success largely stems from the ability to integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However, unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario, which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework, namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\% on Macro-F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.</p></details> |  |

Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.</p></details> |  |

WSNET integrates graph structure, node features, and multiple noisy supervision sources through a contrastive objective tailored for weakly labeled data. Across three real world datasets and synthetic benchmarks with controlled noise, WSNET consistently outperforms state of the art contrastive and noisy label learning methods by up to 15% in F1 score.

Existing methods often apply heuristic augmentation like random edge dropping, which may disrupt important graph structures and result in unstable GCL performance. In this paper, we propose Positive-incentive Noise driven Graph Data Augmentation (PiNGDA), where positive-incentive noise (pi-noise) scientifically analyzes the beneficial effect of noise under the information theory. To bridge the standard GCL and pi-noise framework, we design a Gaussian auxiliary variable to convert the loss function to information entropy. We prove that the standard GCL with pre-defined augmentations is equivalent to estimate the beneficial noise via the point estimation. Following our analysis, PiNGDA is derived from learning the beneficial noise on both topology and attributes through a trainable noise generator for graph augmentations, instead of the simple estimation. Since the generator learns how to produce beneficial perturbations on graph topology and node attributes, PiNGDA is more reliable compared with the existing methods. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and stability of PiNGDA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGCL: Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for User-Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19020v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which fuses graph neural networks with contrastive learning, has evolved as a pivotal tool in user-item recommendations. While promising, existing GCL methods often lack explicit modeling of hierarchical item structures, which represent item similarities across varying resolutions. Such hierarchical item structures are ubiquitous in various items (e.g., online products and local businesses), and reflect their inherent organizational properties that serve as critical signals for enhancing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL), a novel GCL method that incorporates hierarchical item structures for user-item recommendations. First, HGCL pre-trains a GCL module using cross-layer contrastive learning to obtain user and item representations. Second, HGCL employs a representation compression and clustering method to construct a two-hierarchy user-item bipartite graph. Ultimately, HGCL fine-tunes user and item representations by learning on the hierarchical graph, and then provides recommendations based on user-item interaction scores. Experiments on three widely adopted benchmark datasets ranging from 70K to 382K nodes confirm the superior performance of HGCL over existing baseline models, highlighting the contribution of hierarchical item structures in enhancing GCL methods for recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11356v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework that leverages fractal self-similarity to enforce global topological coherence. FractalGCL introduces two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 7%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Influence of Labels on Unlabeled Nodes in Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02279v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The message-passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks (i.e., GCNs) enables label information to reach more unlabeled neighbors, thereby increasing the utilization of labels. However, the additional label information does not always contribute positively to the GCN. To address this issue, we propose a new two-step framework called ELU-GCN. In the first stage, ELU-GCN conducts graph learning to learn a new graph structure (i.e., ELU-graph), which allows the additional label information to positively influence the predictions of GCN. In the second stage, we design a new graph contrastive learning on the GCN framework for representation learning by exploring the consistency and mutually exclusive information between the learned ELU graph and the original graph. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure the generalization ability of GCNs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13650v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work in EDA has mainly focused on pretraining models for digital circuits, overlooking analog and mixed-signal circuits. To bridge this gap, we introduce DICE, a Device-level Integrated Circuits Encoder, which is the first graph neural network (GNN) pretrained via self-supervised learning specifically tailored for graph-level prediction tasks in both analog and digital circuits. DICE adopts a simulation-free pretraining approach based on graph contrastive learning, leveraging two novel graph augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across three downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of DICE for both analog and digital circuits.

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative Metric Learning for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10307v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) often suffers from false negatives, which degrades the performance on downstream tasks. The existing methods addressing the false negative issue usually rely on human prior knowledge, still leading GCL to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Negative Metric Learning (NML) enhanced GCL (NML-GCL). NML-GCL employs a learnable Negative Metric Network (NMN) to build a negative metric space, in which false negatives can be distinguished better from true negatives based on their distance to anchor node. To overcome the lack of explicit supervision signals for NML, we propose a joint training scheme with bi-level optimization objective, which implicitly utilizes the self-supervision signals to iteratively optimize the encoder and the negative metric network. The solid theoretical analysis and the extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Graph Contrastive Learning through Relative Similarity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05533v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025; full version including appendix</p></details> |
| **[InfoNCE is a Free Lunch for Semantically guided Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06282v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at: https://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by SIGIR2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generative Graph Contrastive Learning Model with Global Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18148v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently since it learns complex structural information from graphs through self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely, they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |

A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during graph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on these new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm is effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In this paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient descent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph convolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood aggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability through experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the selection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of CL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel neighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted items while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving high-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity. On three highly sparse public datasets, the proposed method effectively aggregate neighborhood information while preventing graph over-smoothing, demonstrating significant improvements over existing GCL-based counterparts in both training efficiency and recommendation accuracy.

The process of constructing perturbed views of the user-item bipartite graph and performing contrastive learning between perturbed views in a graph convolutional network (GCN) is called graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to enhance the robustness of representation learning. Although existing GCL-based models are effective, the weight assignment method for perturbed views has not been fully explored. A critical problem in existing GCL-based models is the irrational allocation of feature attention. This problem limits the model's ability to effectively leverage crucial features, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Weighted Graph Contrastive Learning framework (WeightedGCL). Specifically, WeightedGCL applies a robust perturbation strategy, which perturbs only the view of the final GCN layer. In addition, WeightedGCL incorporates a squeeze and excitation network (SENet) to dynamically weight the features of the perturbed views. Our WeightedGCL strengthens the model's focus on crucial features and reduces the impact of less relevant information. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our WeightedGCL achieves significant accuracy improvements compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, including text-to-SQL. While prior works have explored various strategies for prompting LLMs to generate SQL statements, they still fall short of fully harnessing the power of LLM due to the lack of (1) high-quality contextual information when constructing the prompts and (2) robust feedback mechanisms to correct translation errors. To address these challenges, we propose MageSQL, a text-to-SQL approach based on in-context learning over LLMs. MageSQL explores a suite of techniques that leverage the syntax and semantics of SQL queries to identify relevant few-shot demonstrations as context for prompting LLMs. In particular, we introduce a graph-based demonstration selection method -- the first of its kind in the text-to-SQL problem -- that leverages graph contrastive learning adapted with SQL-specific data augmentation strategies. Furthermore, an error correction module is proposed to detect and fix potential inaccuracies in the generated SQL query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarking datasets. The results show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.</p></details> |  |

Although graph neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in functional network analysis, challenges such as data scarcity and insufficient supervision persist. To address the limitations of limited training data and inadequate supervision, this paper proposes a novel model named PHGCL-DDGformer that integrates graph contrastive learning with graph transformers, effectively enhancing the representation learning capability for brain network classification tasks. To overcome the constraints of existing graph contrastive learning methods in brain network feature extraction, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy combining attribute masking and edge perturbation is implemented for data enhancement. Subsequently, a dual-domain graph transformer (DDGformer) module is constructed to integrate local and global information, where graph convolutional networks aggregate neighborhood features to capture local patterns while attention mechanisms extract global dependencies. Finally, a graph contrastive learning framework is established to maximize the consistency between positive and negative pairs, thereby obtaining high-quality graph representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the PHGCL-DDGformer model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in brain network classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional supervised learning relying on a large number of labels, GCL exploits augmentation strategies to generate multiple views and positive/negative pairs, both of which greatly influence the performance. Unfortunately, commonly used random augmentations may disturb the underlying semantics of graphs. Moreover, traditional GNNs, a type of widely employed encoders in GCL, are inevitably confronted with over-smoothing and over-squashing problems. To address these issues, we propose GNN-Transformer Cooperative Architecture for Trustworthy Graph Contrastive Learning (GTCA), which inherits the advantages of both GNN and Transformer, incorporating graph topology to obtain comprehensive graph representations.

Despite significant advancements in this domain, including methods based on RNNs and self-attention, challenges like limited supervised signals and noisy data caused by unintentional clicks persist. To address these challenges, some studies have incorporated unsupervised learning by leveraging local item contexts within individual sequences. However, these methods often overlook the intricate associations between items across multiple sequences and are susceptible to noise in item co-occurrence patterns. In this context, we introduce a novel framework, Global Unsupervised Data-Augmentation (UDA4SR), which adopts a graph contrastive learning perspective to generate more robust item embeddings for sequential recommendation. Our approach begins by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, which serves as the first step to enhance the diversity and richness of the training data. Then, we build a Global Item Relationship Graph (GIG) based on all user interaction sequences. Subsequently, we employ graph contrastive learning on the refined graph to enhance item embeddings by capturing complex global associations. To model users' dynamic and diverse interests more effectively, we enhance the CapsNet module with a novel target-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UDA4SR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Effective and Efficient Negative Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17908v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to self-supervised learn low-dimensional graph representations, primarily through instance discrimination, which involves manually mining positive and negative pairs from graphs, increasing the similarity of positive pairs while decreasing negative pairs. Drawing from the success of Contrastive Learning (CL) in other domains, a consensus has been reached that the effectiveness of GCLs depends on a large number of negative pairs. As a result, despite the significant computational overhead, GCLs typically leverage as many negative node pairs as possible to improve model performance. However, given that nodes within a graph are interconnected, we argue that nodes cannot be treated as independent instances. Therefore, we challenge this consensus: Does employing more negative nodes lead to a more effective GCL model? To answer this, we explore the role of negative nodes in the commonly used InfoNCE loss for GCL and observe that: (1) Counterintuitively, a large number of negative nodes can actually hinder the model's ability to distinguish nodes with different semantics. (2) A smaller number of high-quality and non-topologically coupled negative nodes are sufficient to enhance the discriminability of representations. Based on these findings, we propose a new method called GCL with Effective and Efficient Negative samples, E2Neg, which learns discriminative representations using only a very small set of representative negative samples. E2Neg significantly reduces computational overhead and speeds up model training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of E2Neg across multiple datasets compared to other GCL methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) have demonstrated promising potential to alleviate data sparsity issues by improving representation learning through contrastive view generation and mutual information maximization. However, existing approaches lack effective data augmentation strategies. Structural augmentation risks distorting fundamental graph topology, while feature-level perturbation techniques predominantly employ uniform noise scales that fail to account for node-specific characteristics. To solve these challenges, we propose Diffusion-augmented Contrastive Learning (DGCL), an innovative framework that integrates diffusion models with contrastive learning for enhanced collaborative filtering. Our approach employs a diffusion process that learns node-specific Gaussian distributions of representations, thereby generating semantically consistent yet diversified contrastive views through reverse diffusion sampling. DGCL facilitates adaptive data augmentation based on reconstructed representations, considering both semantic coherence and node-specific features. In addition, it explores unrepresented regions of the latent sparse feature space, thereby enriching the diversity of contrastive views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DGCL on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively.

Although existing methods have shown great performance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no graph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph structures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph, for node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision literature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion on Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the performance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are combined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of node-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive learning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level Neighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse effect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank regularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks (GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets for semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank regularization.

| **[SOLA-GCL: Subgraph-Oriented Learnable Augmentation Method for Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10100v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for learning graph representations that are robust and discriminative. However, traditional approaches often neglect the critical role of subgraph structures, particularly the intra-subgraph characteristics and inter-subgraph relationships, which are crucial for generating informative and diverse contrastive pairs. These subgraph features are crucial as they vary significantly across different graph types, such as social networks where they represent communities, and biochemical networks where they symbolize molecular interactions. To address this issue, our work proposes a novel subgraph-oriented learnable augmentation method for graph contrastive learning, termed SOLA-GCL, that centers around subgraphs, taking full advantage of the subgraph information for data augmentation. Specifically, SOLA-GCL initially partitions a graph into multiple densely connected subgraphs based on their intrinsic properties. To preserve and enhance the unique characteristics inherent to subgraphs, a graph view generator optimizes augmentation strategies for each subgraph, thereby generating tailored views for graph contrastive learning. This generator uses a combination of intra-subgraph and inter-subgraph augmentation strategies, including node dropping, feature masking, intra-edge perturbation, inter-edge perturbation, and subgraph swapping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various graph learning applications, ranging from social networks to molecules, under semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer learning settings to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in GCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15247v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance graph neural networks' (GNNs) ability to learn rich representations from unlabeled graph-structured data. However, current GCL models face challenges with computational demands and limited feature utilization, often relying only on basic graph properties like node degrees and edge attributes. This constrains their capacity to fully capture the complex topological characteristics of real-world phenomena represented by graphs. To address these limitations, we propose Tensor-Fused Multi-View Graph Contrastive Learning (TensorMV-GCL), a novel framework that integrates extended persistent homology (EPH) with GCL representations and facilitates multi-scale feature extraction. Our approach uniquely employs tensor aggregation and compression to fuse information from graph and topological features obtained from multiple augmented views of the same graph. By incorporating tensor concatenation and contraction modules, we reduce computational overhead by separating feature tensor aggregation and transformation. Furthermore, we enhance the quality of learned topological features and model robustness through noise-injected EPH. Experiments on molecular, bioinformatic, and social network datasets demonstrate TensorMV-GCL's superiority, outperforming 15 state-of-the-art methods in graph classification tasks across 9 out of 11 benchmarks while achieving comparable results on the remaining two. The code for this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/CS-SAIL/Tensor-MV-GCL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Masked Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning for Mining Interactions Between Proteins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04650v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is an instrumental means in elucidating the mechanisms underlying cellular operations, holding significant practical implications for the realms of pharmaceutical development and clinical treatment. Presently, the majority of research methods primarily concentrate on the analysis of amino acid sequences, while investigations predicated on protein structures remain in the nascent stages of exploration. Despite the emergence of several structure-based algorithms in recent years, these are still confronted with inherent challenges: (1) the extraction of intrinsic structural information of proteins typically necessitates the expenditure of substantial computational resources; (2) these models are overly reliant on seen protein data, struggling to effectively unearth interaction cues between unknown proteins. To further propel advancements in this domain, this paper introduces a novel PPI prediction method jointing masked reconstruction and contrastive learning, termed JmcPPI. This methodology dissects the PPI prediction task into two distinct phases: during the residue structure encoding phase, JmcPPI devises two feature reconstruction tasks and employs graph attention mechanism to capture structural information between residues; during the protein interaction inference phase, JmcPPI perturbs the original PPI graph and employs a multi-graph contrastive learning strategy to thoroughly mine extrinsic interaction information of novel proteins. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely utilized PPI datasets demonstrate that JmcPPI surpasses existing optimal baseline models across various data partition schemes. The associated code can be accessed via https://github.com/lijfrank-open/JmcPPI.</p></details> | Submitted |

However, the problem of insufficient supervision, together with representation collapse, largely limits the performance of the GNNs in this field. To alleviate the collapse of node representations in semi-supervised scenario, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, termed Mixed Graph Contrastive Network (MGCN). In our method, we improve the discriminative capability of the latent embeddings by an interpolation-based augmentation strategy and a correlation reduction mechanism. Specifically, we first conduct the interpolation-based augmentation in the latent space and then force the prediction model to change linearly between samples. Second, we enable the learned network to tell apart samples across two interpolation-perturbed views through forcing the correlation matrix across views to approximate an identity matrix. By combining the two settings, we extract rich supervision information from both the abundant unlabeled nodes and the rare yet valuable labeled nodes for discriminative representation learning. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the generality of MGCN compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code of MGCN is available at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/MGCN on Github.</p></details> |  |

The available benchmark datasets are citation, co-occurrence, e-commerce networks, etc, with classes ranging from 3 to 15. However, there is no benchmark classification social network dataset for graph machine learning. This paper fills the gap and presents the Binary Classification Social Network Dataset (\textit{BiSND}), designed for graph machine learning applications to predict binary classes. We present the BiSND in \textit{tabular and graph} formats to verify its robustness across classical and advanced machine learning. We employ a diverse set of classifiers, including four traditional machine learning algorithms (Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, XGBoost), one Deep Neural Network (multi-layer perceptrons), one Graph Neural Network (Graph Convolutional Network), and three state-of-the-art Graph Contrastive Learning methods (BGRL, GRACE, DAENS). Our findings reveal that BiSND is suitable for classification tasks, with F1-scores ranging from 67.66 to 70.15, indicating promising avenues for future enhancements.</p></details> |  |

While graph machine learning holds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext tasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging. Contrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning, leverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function. However, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use structural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present a new method called Fused Gromov Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning (FOSSIL). Our model integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive learning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture both node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach works well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically create views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, relying on predefined augmentations (e.g., node dropping, edge perturbation, attribute masking) may result in the loss of task-relevant information and a lack of adaptability to diverse input data. Furthermore, the selection of negative samples remains rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce HyperGCL, a novel multimodal GCL framework from a hypergraph perspective. HyperGCL constructs three distinct hypergraph views by jointly utilizing the input graph's structure and attributes, enabling a comprehensive integration of multiple modalities in contrastive learning. A learnable adaptive topology augmentation technique enhances these views by preserving important relations and filtering out noise. View-specific encoders capture essential characteristics from each view, while a network-aware contrastive loss leverages the underlying topology to define positive and negative samples effectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperGCL achieves state-of-the-art node classification performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Understanding and Mitigating Hyperbolic Dimensional Collapse in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18209v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalizable self-supervised graph representations for downstream tasks is challenging. To this end, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a leading approach. The embeddings of CL are arranged on a hypersphere where similarity is measured by the cosine distance. However, many real-world graphs, especially of hierarchical nature, cannot be embedded well in the Euclidean space. Although the hyperbolic embedding is suitable for hierarchical representation learning, naively applying CL to the hyperbolic space may result in the so-called dimension collapse, i.e., features will concentrate mostly within few density regions, leading to poor utilization of the whole feature space. Thus, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embeddings in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of the uniformity metric to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity related to properties of trees. In the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments support the efficacy of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by The 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[AS-GCL: Asymmetric Spectral Augmentation on Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13525v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as the foremost approach for self-supervised learning on graph-structured data. GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |

GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EMBC '25</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning Meets Pseudo-label-assisted Mixup Augmentation: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Framework from Local to Global](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18357v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various graph representation learning tasks. However, most existing GNNs focus primarily on capturing local information through explicit graph convolution, often neglecting global message-passing. This limitation hinders the establishment of a collaborative interaction between global and local information, which is crucial for comprehensively understanding graph data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information into global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by implicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive learning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration. Then ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head self-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering diverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information dynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a triple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable Mixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive learning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates coordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to reinforce each other. Experimental results across six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that ComGRL achieves excellent performance in node classification tasks. The code could be available at https://github.com/JinluWang1002/ComGRL.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Fusion Self-supervised Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19692v4)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are widely deployed in various web environments, and self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently attracted significant attention in this field. Contrastive learning (CL) stands out as a major SSL paradigm due to its robust ability to generate self-supervised signals. Mainstream graph contrastive learning (GCL)-based methods typically implement CL by creating contrastive views through various data augmentation techniques. Despite these methods are effective, we argue that there still exist several challenges. i) Data augmentation ($e.g.,$ discarding edges or adding noise) necessitates additional graph convolution (GCN) or modeling operations, which are highly time-consuming and potentially harm the embedding quality. ii) Existing CL-based methods use traditional CL objectives to capture self-supervised signals. However, few studies have explored obtaining CL objectives from more perspectives and have attempted to fuse the varying signals from these CL objectives to enhance recommendation performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Fusion Self-supervised Learning framework for recommendation. Specifically, instead of facilitating data augmentations, we use high-order information from GCN process to create contrastive views. Additionally, to integrate self-supervised signals from various CL objectives, we propose an advanced CL objective. By ensuring that positive pairs are distanced from negative samples derived from both contrastive views, we effectively fuse self-supervised signals from distinct CL objectives, thereby enhancing the mutual information between positive pairs. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superior recommendation performance and efficiency of HFGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Leading contrastive learning works show two kinds of view generators, that is, random or learnable data corruption and domain knowledge incorporation. While effective, the two ways also lead to molecular semantics altering and limited generalization capability, respectively. To this end, we relate the \textbf{L}in\textbf{E} graph with \textbf{MO}lecular graph co\textbf{N}trastive learning and propose a novel method termed \textit{LEMON}. Specifically, by contrasting the given graph with the corresponding line graph, the graph encoder can freely encode the molecular semantics without omission.

However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

One of the representative paradigms is graph contrastive learning. It constructs self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between the statistic graph's augmentation views. However, the semantics and labels may change within the augmentation process, causing a significant performance drop in downstream tasks. This drawback becomes greatly magnified on dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we designed a simple yet effective framework named CLDG. Firstly, we elaborate that dynamic graphs have temporal translation invariance at different levels. Then, we proposed a sampling layer to extract the temporally-persistent signals. It will encourage the node to maintain consistent local and global representations, i.e., temporal translation invariance under the timespan views. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method on seven datasets by outperforming eight unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines and showing competitiveness against four semi-supervised methods. Compared with the existing dynamic graph method, the number of model parameters and training time is reduced by an average of 2,001.86 times and 130.31 times on seven datasets, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2023 |

In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 tables |

However, edgelevel contrasts are not well explored by most existing GCL methods. Most studies in GCL only regard edges as auxiliary information while updating node features. One of the primary obstacles of edge-based GCL is the heavy computation burden. To tackle this issue, we propose a model that can efficiently learn edge features for GCL, namely AugmentationFree Edge Contrastive Learning (AFECL) to achieve edgeedge contrast. AFECL depends on no augmentation consisting of two parts. Firstly, we design a novel edge feature generation method, where edge features are computed by embedding concatenation of their connected nodes. Secondly, an edge contrastive learning scheme is developed, where edges connecting the same nodes are defined as positive pairs, and other edges are defined as negative pairs.

To mitigate reliance on cross-view contrasts, we propose \ttt{SIGNA}, a novel single-view graph contrastive learning framework. Regarding the inconsistency between structural connection and semantic similarity of neighborhoods, we resort to soft neighborhood awareness for GCL. Specifically, we leverage dropout to obtain structurally-related yet randomly-noised embedding pairs for neighbors, which serve as potential positive samples. At each epoch, the role of partial neighbors is switched from positive to negative, leading to probabilistic neighborhood contrastive learning effect. Furthermore, we propose a normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence estimator for a better effect of contrastive learning. Surprisingly, experiments on diverse node-level tasks demonstrate that our simple single-view GCL framework consistently outperforms existing methods by margins of up to 21.74% (PPI). In particular, with soft neighborhood awareness, SIGNA can adopt MLPs instead of complicated GCNs as the encoder to generate representations in transductive learning tasks, thus speeding up its inference process by 109 times to 331 times.

| **[Uncovering Capabilities of Model Pruning in Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20356v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has achieved great success in pre-training graph neural networks without ground-truth labels. Leading graph contrastive learning follows the classical scheme of contrastive learning, forcing model to identify the essential information from augmented views. However, general augmented views are produced via random corruption or learning, which inevitably leads to semantics alteration. Although domain knowledge guided augmentations alleviate this issue, the generated views are domain specific and undermine the generalization. In this work, motivated by the firm representation ability of sparse model from pruning, we reformulate the problem of graph contrastive learning via contrasting different model versions rather than augmented views. We first theoretically reveal the superiority of model pruning in contrast to data augmentations. In practice, we take original graph as input and dynamically generate a perturbed graph encoder to contrast with the original encoder by pruning its transformation weights. Furthermore, considering the integrity of node embedding in our method, we are capable of developing a local contrastive loss to tackle the hard negative samples that disturb the model training. We extensively validate our method on various benchmarks regarding graph classification via unsupervised and transfer learning. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works, better performance can always be obtained by the proposed method.</p></details> | MM' 24 |
| **[Enhancing Graph Contrastive Learning with Reliable and Informative Augmentation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05633v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network(GNN) has been a powerful approach in collaborative filtering(CF) due to its ability to model high-order user-item relationships. Recently, to alleviate the data sparsity and enhance representation learning, many efforts have been conducted to integrate contrastive learning(CL) with GNNs. Despite the promising improvements, the contrastive view generation based on structure and representation perturbations in existing methods potentially disrupts the collaborative information in contrastive views, resulting in limited effectiveness of positive alignment. To overcome this issue, we propose CoGCL, a novel framework that aims to enhance graph contrastive learning by constructing contrastive views with stronger collaborative information via discrete codes. The core idea is to map users and items into discrete codes rich in collaborative information for reliable and informative contrastive view generation. To this end, we initially introduce a multi-level vector quantizer in an end-to-end manner to quantize user and item representations into discrete codes. Based on these discrete codes, we enhance the collaborative information of contrastive views by considering neighborhood structure and semantic relevance respectively. For neighborhood structure, we propose virtual neighbor augmentation by treating discrete codes as virtual neighbors, which expands an observed user-item interaction into multiple edges involving discrete codes. Regarding semantic relevance, we identify similar users/items based on shared discrete codes and interaction targets to generate the semantically relevant view. Through these strategies, we construct contrastive views with stronger collaborative information and develop a triple-view graph contrastive learning approach. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCLS$^2$: Towards Efficient Community Detection Using Graph Contrastive Learning with Structure Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11273v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the power of learning representations from unlabeled graphs, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in community detection tasks. Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually focused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which, however, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same community should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will consider the community detection under the community structure semantics and propose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure semantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior dense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive learning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level structural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment the original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the structure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes, which can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale networks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that minimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is worth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the perspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more accurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$ outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy, modularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.</p></details> |  |

However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning via Seamless Proximity Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15270v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aligns node representations by classifying node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented graphs. The conventional GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICDM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Multi-graph Learning with Neighbor Hierarchical Sifting for Semi-supervised Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16787v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning has been successfully applied in text classification due to its remarkable ability for self-supervised node representation learning. However, explicit graph augmentations may lead to a loss of semantics in the contrastive views. Secondly, existing methods tend to overlook edge features and the varying significance of node features during multi-graph learning. Moreover, the contrastive loss suffer from false negatives. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method of contrastive multi-graph learning with neighbor hierarchical sifting for semi-supervised text classification, namely ConNHS. Specifically, we exploit core features to form a multi-relational text graph, enhancing semantic connections among texts. By separating text graphs, we provide diverse views for contrastive learning. Our approach ensures optimal preservation of the graph information, minimizing data loss and distortion. Then, we separately execute relation-aware propagation and cross-graph attention propagation, which effectively leverages the varying correlations between nodes and edge features while harmonising the information fusion across graphs. Subsequently, we present the neighbor hierarchical sifting loss (NHS) to refine the negative selection. For one thing, following the homophily assumption, NHS masks first-order neighbors of the anchor and positives from being negatives. For another, NHS excludes the high-order neighbors analogous to the anchor based on their similarities. Consequently, it effectively reduces the occurrence of false negatives, preventing the expansion of the distance between similar samples in the embedding space. Our experiments on ThuCNews, SogouNews, 20 Newsgroups, and Ohsumed datasets achieved 95.86\%, 97.52\%, 87.43\%, and 70.65\%, which demonstrates competitive results in semi-supervised text classification.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Especially inductive GNNs, which allow for the processing of graph-structured data without relying on predefined graph structures, are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. As such these networks become attractive targets for model-stealing attacks where an adversary seeks to replicate the functionality of the targeted network. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing model-stealing attacks that extract models trained on images and texts. However, little attention has been given to stealing GNNs trained on graph data. This paper identifies a new method of performing unsupervised model-stealing attacks against inductive GNNs, utilizing graph contrastive learning and spectral graph augmentations to efficiently extract information from the targeted model. The new type of attack is thoroughly evaluated on six datasets and the results show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art by Shen et al. (2021). In particular, our attack surpasses the baseline across all benchmarks, attaining superior fidelity and downstream accuracy of the stolen model while necessitating fewer queries directed toward the target model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI - 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to detect fake news on future events. Recently, numerous fake news detection models that utilize textual information and the propagation structure of posts have been proposed. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge since they rely heavily on event-specific features for prediction and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce \textbf{F}uture \textbf{AD}aptive \textbf{E}vent-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to obtain higher-quality features and make more accurate overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. We further mitigate event bias by subtracting the event-only predictor's output from the target predictor's output to obtain the final prediction. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Graph Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07150v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph representation learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of graph characteristics while controlling the distribution of generated subgraphs. We employ optimal transport distances, including Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGEC outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negative-Free Self-Supervised Gaussian Embedding of Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01157v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising graph self-supervised learning framework for learning discriminative node representations without labels. The widely adopted objective function of GCL benefits from two key properties: \emph{alignment} and \emph{uniformity}, which align representations of positive node pairs while uniformly distributing all representations on the hypersphere. The uniformity property plays a critical role in preventing representation collapse and is achieved by pushing apart augmented views of different nodes (negative pairs). As such, existing GCL methods inherently rely on increasing the quantity and quality of negative samples, resulting in heavy computational demands, memory overhead, and potential class collision issues. In this study, we propose a negative-free objective to achieve uniformity, inspired by the fact that points distributed according to a normalized isotropic Gaussian are uniformly spread across the unit hypersphere. Therefore, we can minimize the distance between the distribution of learned representations and the isotropic Gaussian distribution to promote the uniformity of node representations. Our method also distinguishes itself from other approaches by eliminating the need for a parameterized mutual information estimator, an additional projector, asymmetric structures, and, crucially, negative samples. Extensive experiments over seven graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposal achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, shorter training times, and lower memory consumption compared to existing GCL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks</p></details> |

Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The one of the effective ways to reduce the number of samples is using hard negatives (e.g., Mixup). Designing mixing-based approach for GAD can be difficult due to imbalanced data or limited number of anomalies. We propose ANOMIX, a framework that consists of a novel graph mixing approach, ANOMIX-M, and multi-level contrasts for GAD. ANOMIX-M can effectively mix abnormality and normality from input graph to generate hard negatives, which are important for efficient GCL. ANOMIX is (a) A first mixing approach: firstly attempting graph mixing to generate hard negatives for GAD task and node- and subgraph-level contrasts to distinguish underlying anomalies. (b) Accurate: winning the highest AUC, up to 5.49% higher and 1.76% faster. (c) Effective: reducing the number of samples nearly 80% in GCL.

As IoT devices proliferate and rapidly evolve, their highly heterogeneous hardware architectures and complex compilation settings, coupled with the demand for large-scale function retrieval in practical applications, put forward higher requirements for BCSD methods. In this paper, we propose IRBinDiff, which mitigates compilation differences by leveraging LLVM-IR with higher-level semantic abstraction, and integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph neural network to capture both semantic and structural information from different perspectives. By introducing momentum contrastive learning, it effectively enhances retrieval capabilities in large-scale candidate function sets, distinguishing between subtle function similarities and differences. Our extensive experiments, conducted under varied compilation settings, demonstrate that IRBinDiff outperforms other leading BCSD methods in both One-to-one comparison and One-to-many search scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

A recommender system is considered unfair when it produces unequal outcomes for different user groups based on user-sensitive attributes (e.g., age, gender). Some researchers have proposed data augmentation-based methods aiming at alleviating user-level unfairness by altering the skewed distribution of training data among various user groups. Despite yielding promising results, they often rely on fairness-related assumptions that may not align with reality, potentially reducing the data quality and negatively affecting model effectiveness. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study how to implement high-quality data augmentation to improve recommendation fairness. Specifically, we propose FairDgcl, a dynamic graph adversarial contrastive learning framework aiming at improving fairness in recommender system. First, FairDgcl develops an adversarial contrastive network with a view generator and a view discriminator to learn generating fair augmentation strategies in an adversarial style. Then, we propose two dynamic, learnable models to generate contrastive views within contrastive learning framework, which automatically fine-tune the augmentation strategies. Meanwhile, we theoretically show that FairDgcl can simultaneously generate enhanced representations that possess both fairness and accuracy. Lastly, comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FairDgcl.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to TKDE</p></details> |

The existing research on efficient data augmentation methods and ideal pretext tasks for graph contrastive learning remains limited, resulting in suboptimal node representation in the unsupervised setting. In this paper, we introduce LAC, a graph contrastive learning framework with learnable data augmentation in an orthogonal continuous space. To capture the representative information in the graph data during augmentation, we introduce a continuous view augmenter, that applies both a masked topology augmentation module and a cross-channel feature augmentation module to adaptively augment the topological information and the feature information within an orthogonal continuous space, respectively. The orthogonal nature of continuous space ensures that the augmentation process avoids dimension collapse. To enhance the effectiveness of pretext tasks, we propose an information-theoretic principle named InfoBal and introduce corresponding pretext tasks. These tasks enable the continuous view augmenter to maintain consistency in the representative information across views while maximizing diversity between views, and allow the encoder to fully utilize the representative information in the unsupervised setting. Our experimental results show that LAC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning via Cluster-refined Negative Sampling for Semi-supervised Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18130v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely applied to text classification tasks due to its ability to generate self-supervised signals from unlabeled data, thus facilitating model training. However, existing GCL-based text classification methods often suffer from negative sampling bias, where similar nodes are incorrectly paired as negative pairs. This can lead to over-clustering, where instances of the same class are divided into different clusters. To address the over-clustering issue, we propose an innovative GCL-based method of graph contrastive learning via cluster-refined negative sampling for semi-supervised text classification, namely ClusterText. Firstly, we combine the pre-trained model Bert with graph neural networks to learn text representations. Secondly, we introduce a clustering refinement strategy, which clusters the learned text representations to obtain pseudo labels. For each text node, its negative sample set is drawn from different clusters. Additionally, we propose a self-correction mechanism to mitigate the loss of true negative samples caused by clustering inconsistency. By calculating the Euclidean distance between each text node and other nodes within the same cluster, distant nodes are still selected as negative samples. Our proposed ClusterText demonstrates good scalable computing, as it can effectively extract important information from from a large amount of data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ClusterText in text classification tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Our study finds that the difference in high-frequency information between augmented graphs is greater than that in low-frequency information. However, most existing GCL methods focus mainly on the time domain (low-frequency information) for node feature representations and cannot make good use of high-frequency information to speed up model convergence. Furthermore, existing GCL paradigms optimize graph embedding representations by pulling the distance between positive sample pairs closer and pushing the distance between positive and negative sample pairs farther away, but our theoretical analysis shows that graph contrastive learning benefits from pushing negative pairs farther away rather than pulling positive pairs closer. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel spectral GCL framework without positive samples, named SpeGCL. Specifically, to solve the problem that existing GCL methods cannot utilize high-frequency information, SpeGCL uses a Fourier transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency information of node features, and constructs a contrastive learning mechanism in a Fourier space to obtain better node feature representation. Furthermore, SpeGCL relies entirely on negative samples to refine the graph embedding. We also provide a theoretical justification for the efficacy of using only negative samples in SpeGCL. Extensive experiments on un-supervised learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning have validated the superiority of our SpeGCL framework over the state-of-the-art GCL methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

These changes lead to temporal degradation in entity linking models, characterized as a decline in model performance over time. To address this issue, we propose leveraging graph relationships to aggregate information from neighboring entities across different time periods. This approach enhances the ability to distinguish similar entities over time, thereby minimizing the impact of temporal degradation. We introduce \textbf{CYCLE}: \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{Y}ear \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for \textbf{E}ntity-Linking. This model employs a novel graph contrastive learning method to tackle temporal performance degradation in entity linking tasks. Our contrastive learning method treats newly added graph relationships as \textit{positive} samples and newly removed ones as \textit{negative} samples. This approach helps our model effectively prevent temporal degradation, achieving a 13.90\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art from 2023 when the time gap is one year, and a 17.79\% improvement as the gap expands to three years. Further analysis shows that CYCLE is particularly robust for low-degree entities, which are less resistant to temporal degradation due to their sparse connectivity, making them particularly suitable for our method.

| **[Towards Cross-domain Few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08629v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot graph anomaly detection (GAD) has recently garnered increasing attention, which aims to discern anomalous patterns among abundant unlabeled test nodes under the guidance of a limited number of labeled training nodes. Existing few-shot GAD approaches typically adopt meta-training methods trained on richly labeled auxiliary networks to facilitate rapid adaptation to target networks that possess sparse labels. However, these proposed methods often assume that the auxiliary and target networks exist in the same data distributions-an assumption rarely holds in practical settings. This paper explores a more prevalent and complex scenario of cross-domain few-shot GAD, where the goal is to identify anomalies within sparsely labeled target graphs using auxiliary graphs from a related, yet distinct domain. The challenge here is nontrivial owing to inherent data distribution discrepancies between the source and target domains, compounded by the uncertainties of sparse labeling in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework, termed CDFS-GAD, specifically designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. CDFS-GAD first introduces a domain-adaptive graph contrastive learning module, which is aimed at enhancing cross-domain feature alignment. Then, a prompt tuning module is further designed to extract domain-specific features tailored to each domain. Moreover, a domain-adaptive hypersphere classification loss is proposed to enhance the discrimination between normal and anomalous instances under minimal supervision, utilizing domain-sensitive norms. Lastly, a self-training strategy is introduced to further refine the predicted scores, enhancing its reliability in few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on twelve real-world cross-domain data pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDFS-GAD framework in comparison to various existing GAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 24th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2024)</p></details> |

While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture.

| **[Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations: feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture. Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying homophily-heterophily characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07373v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under differential privacy protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270v6)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction builds on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes -- namely, the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET -- which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar--Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). Both the $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs adopt a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN), cascading the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation -- akin to local pooling in CNNs -- that can be performed either locally or per scale. Such pooling operations are more difficult to define in traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets and in geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, our approach extracts a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be combined with simple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification with far fewer trainable parameters than most modern graph neural networks require. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MHSNs on three distinct problem types: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, Comments Welcome</p></details> |

Its clinical and biological heterogeneity makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks (XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.</p></details> |  |

Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features. These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial institutions to enhance AML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) Research Institute Annual Meeting, Las Vegas, NV, (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect on Networks via Orthogonal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18484v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating causal effects on networks is important for both scientific research and practical applications. Unlike traditional settings that assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an intervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others. Understanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks faces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous, varying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units often exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between structural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on networks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance components that depend on the complex network topology. In the second stage, we adjust for network confounding using these estimates and infer causal effects through a novel attention-based interference model. Our approach balances expressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as identifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover effects. We integrate the two stages using Neyman orthogonalization and cross-fitting, which ensures that errors from nuisance estimation contribute only at higher order. As a result, our causal effect estimates are robust to bias and misspecification in modeling causal effects under network dependencies.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18325v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
